was just standing there alone\\nLooking at the shiny red tractor\\nHim and his daddy used to sit inside\\nAnd circle the blue fields and grease the night.\\nIt was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars\\n'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.\\nThen he put his head in the crux of his arm\\nAnd he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,\\nLet the ship slide open, and he went inside of it\\nAnd saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,\\nHe saw his daddy 'hind the control board,\\nAnd he was very different tonight\\n'Cause he was not human, he was not human.\\n\\nAnd then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy\\nThat the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,\\nWhite lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly\\nAnd he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,\\nNo black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven\\nAnd fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,\\n\\u201cNo, daddy, don't leave me here alone,\\nTake me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,\\nLet the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it\\nWhere you're not human, you are not human.\\u201d\\n\\nBut nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.\\nNobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm\\nAnd they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered\\nAnd they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet\\nSlit in his nose and all the others went shooting\\nAnd he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake\\nGrabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,\\nAll his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,\\n\\u201cI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,\\nI won't give up, come here,

won't let up and I see them coming in,\\nOh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,\\nIt's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights\\nMoving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,\\nAnd he put up his hands and he said, \\u201cIt's me, it's me,\\nI'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,\\nI'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,\\nDon't let me here,\\u201d the son, the sign, the cross,\\nLike the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,\\nThe mother standing in the doorway letting her sons\\nNo

like a black bouquet shining\\nLike a fist that's gonna shoot them up\\nLike light, like Mohammed Boxer\\nTake them up up up up up up\\nOh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,\\nI'm going up, I'm going up\\nTake me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there\\nGo up go up go up go up up up up up up up\\nUp, up to the belly of a ship.\\nLet the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it\\nWhere we are not human, we're not human.\\n\\nWell, there was sand, there were tiles,\\nThe sun had melted the sand and it coagulated\\nLike a river of glass\\nWhen it hardened he looked at the surface\\nHe saw his face\\nAnd where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,\\nWhere there were eyes there were just two white opals\\nAnd he looked up and the rays shot\\nAnd he saw raven comin'

everything's warmer there\\nSo you write him a letter, say, \\\"her eyes are blue\\\"\\nHe sends you a poem and she's lost to you\\nLittle, green, he's a non-comformer Just a little green\\nLike the color when the spring is born\\nThere'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow\\nJust a little green\\nLike the night's when the Northern lights perform\\nThere'll be icicles and birthday clothes and sometimes\\nThere'll be sorrow Child with a child pretending\\nWeary of lies you're sending home\\nSo you sign all the papers in the family name\\nYou're sad and you're sorry but you're not

to leave here Carey\\nBut it's really not my home\\nMy fingernails are filthy\\nI've got beach tar on my feet\\nAnd I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne Oh Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)\\nAnd I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nOh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe\\nAnd I will buy you a bottle of

put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nYou're a mean old Daddy, but I like you The wind is in from Africa\\nLast night I couldn't sleep\\nOh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, but it's\\nReally not my home\\nMaybe it's been too long a time since I was\\nScramblin' down in the street\\nNow they got me used to that clean white linen and that\\nFancy French cologne Oh Carey, get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)\\nI'll put on my finest silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nWe'll go to the Mermaid Cafe, have fun tonight\\nI said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight I came upon a child of God\\nHe was walking along the road\\nAnd I asked him, where are you going\\nAnd this he told me\\nI'm going on down to Yasgur's farm\\nI'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band\\nI'm going to camp out on the land\\nI'm going to try an' get my soul free\\nWe are stardust\\nWe are golden\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden Then can I walk beside you\\nI have come here to lose the smog\\nAnd I feel to be a cog in something turning\\nWell maybe it is just the time of year\\nOr maybe it's the time of man\\nI don't know who l am\\nBut you know life is for learning\\nWe are stardust\\nWe are golden\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden By the time we got to Woodstock\\nWe were half a million strong\\nAnd everywhere there was song and celebration\\nAnd I dreamed I saw the bombers\\nRiding shotgun in the sky\\nAnd they were turning into butterflies\\nAbove our nation\\nWe are stardust\\nBillion year old carbon\\nWe are golden\\nCaught in the devil's bargain\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden I'm traveling in some vehicle\\nI'm sitting in some cafe\\nA defector from the petty wars\\nThat shell shocked love away There's comfort in melancholy\\nWhen there's no need to explain\\nIt's just as natural as the weather\\nIn this moody sky today In our possessive coupling\\nSo much could not be expressed\\nSo now I'm returning to myself\\nThese things that you and I suppressed I see something of myself in everyone\\nJust at this moment of the world\\nAs snow gathers like bolts of lace\\nWaltzing on a ballroom girl You know it never has been easy\\nWhether you do or you do not resign\\nWhether you travel the breadth of extremities\\nOr stick to some straighter line Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock\\nThey're either going to thaw out or freeze\\nListen...strains of Benny Goodman\\nComing through' the snow and the pinewood trees I'm porous with travel fever\\nBut you know I'm so glad to be on my own\\nStill somehow the slightest touch of a stranger\\nCan set up trembling in my bones I know, no one's going to show me everything\\nWe all come and go unknown\\nEach so deep and superficial\\nBetween the forceps and the stone Well I looked at the granite markers\\nThose tribute to finality, to eternity\\nAnd then I looked at myself here\\nChicken scratching for my immortality In the church they light the candles\\nAnd the wax rolls down like tears\\nThere's the hope and the hopelessness\\nI've witnessed thirty years We're only particles of change I know, I know\\nOrbiting around the sun\\nBut how can I have that point of view\\nWhen I'm always bound and tied to someone White flags of winter chimneys\\nWaving truce against the moon\\nIn the mirrors of a modern bank\\nFrom the window of a hotel room I'm traveling in some vehicle\\nI'm sitting in some cafe\\nA defector from the petty wars\\nUntil love sucks me back that way My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nThe way he described it\\nHe said I'd be better dead than live\\nI didn't listen to his jive\\nI knew all along\\nThat he was all wrong\\nAnd I knew that he thought\\nI was crazy but I'm not, oh no My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nHe said I'd need treatment\\nBut I'm not that easily led\\nHe said I was the type\\nThat was most inclined\\nWhen out of his sight\\nTo be out of my mind\\nAnd he thought I was nuts\\nNo more ifs or ands or buts They say as a child\\nI appeared a little bit wild\\nWith all my crazy ideas\\nBut I knew what was happening\\nI knew I was a genius\\nWhat's so strange when you know\\nThat you're a wizard at three?\\nI knew that this was meant to be Now I heard little children\\nWere supposed to sleep tight\\nThat's why I got into the vodka one night\\nMy parents got frantic\\nDidn't know what to do\\nBut I saw some crazy scenes\\nBefore I came to\\nNow do you think I was crazy?\\nI may have been only three\\nBut I was swinging They all laugh at angry young men\\nThey all laugh at Edison\\nAnd also at Einstein\\nSo why should I feel sorry\\nIf they just couldn't understand\\nThe idiomatic logic\\nThat went on in my head\\nI had a brain\\nIt was insane\\nOh, they used to laugh at me\\nWhen I refused to ride\\nOn all those double decker buses\\nAll because there was no driver on the top My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nBut I said dear doctor\\nI think that it's you instead\\nBecause I have got a thing\\nThat's unique and new\\nTo prove it I'll have\\nThe last laugh on you\\n'Cause instead of one head\\nI got two\\nAnd you know two heads are better than one Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard\\nWas a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words\\nIt came a-reeling up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums Oh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nAnd we'll wear it 'till the night comes Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw\\nWas the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall\\nBlue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon Oh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nThere's a sun show every second Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today\\nAnd the streets are paved with passersby\\nAnd pigeons fly\\nAnd papers lie\\nWaiting to blow away Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew\\nThere was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too\\nAnd the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses\\nOh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nAnd we'll talk in present tenses When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away\\nI will bring you incense owls by night\\nBy candlelight\\nBy jewel-light\\nIf only you will stay\\nPretty baby, won't you\\nWake up, it's a Chelsea morning I was driving across the burning desert\\nWhen I spotted six jet planes\\nLeaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain\\nIt was the hexagram of the heavens\\nit was the strings of my guitar\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines\\nIs a song so wild and blue\\nIt scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you\\nThen your life becomes a travelogue\\nOf picture-post-card-charms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm People will tell you where they've gone\\nThey'll tell you where to go\\nBut till you get there yourself you never really know\\nWhere some have found their paradise\\nOthers just come to harm\\nOh Amelia, it was just a false alarm I wish that he was here tonight\\nIt's so hard to obey\\nHis sad request of me to kindly stay away\\nSo this is how I hide the hurt\\nAs the road leads cursed and charmed\\nI tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation\\nShe was swallowed by the sky\\nOr by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly\\nLike Icarus ascending\\nOn beautiful foolish arms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm Maybe I've never really loved\\nI guess that is the truth\\nI've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude\\nAnd looking down on everything\\nI crashed into his arms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel\\nTo shower off the dust\\nAnd I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust\\nI dreamed of 747's\\nOver geometric farms\\nDreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms I went to Staten Island.\\nTo buy myself a mandolin\\nAnd I saw the long white dress of love\\nOn a storefront mannequin\\nBig boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,\\nAll for something lacy\\nSome girl's going to see that dress\\nAnd crave that day like crazy Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada\\nThey can balance and they can climb\\nLike their fathers before them\\nThey'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline\\nShine your light on me Miss Liberty\\nBecause as soon as this ferry boat docks\\nI'm headed to the church\\nTo play Bingo\\nFleece me with the gamblers' flocks I can keep my cool at poker\\nBut I'm a fool when love's at stake\\nBecause I can't conceal emotion\\nWhat I'm feeling's always written on my face\\nThere's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street\\nI went in to see her as a kind of joke\\nAnd she lit a candle for my love luck\\nAnd eighteen bucks went up in smoke Sharon, I left my man\\nAt a North Dakota junction\\nAnd I came out to the \\\"Big Apple\\\" here\\nTo face the dream's malfunction\\nLove's a repetitious danger\\nYou'd think I'd be accustomed to\\nWell, I do accept the changes\\nAt least better than I used to do A woman I knew just drowned herself\\nThe well was deep and muddy\\nShe was just shaking off futility\\nOr punishing somebody\\nMy friends were calling up all day yesterday\\nAll emotions and abstractions\\nIt seems we all live so close to that line\\nAnd so far from satisfaction Dora says, \\\"Have children!\\\"\\nMama and Betsy say-\\\"Find yourself a charity.\\\"\\nHelp the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.\\\"\\nWell, there's a wide wide world of noble causes\\nAnd lovely landscapes to discover\\nBut all I really want right now\\nIs, find another lover When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon\\nI went to every wedding in that little town\\nTo see the tears and the kisses\\nAnd the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown\\nAnd walking home on the railroad tracks\\nOr swinging on the playground swing\\nLove stimulated my illusions\\nMore than anything And when I went skating after Golden Reggie\\nYou know it was white lace I was chasing\\nChasing dreams\\nMama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans\\nHe showed me first you get the kisses\\nAnd then you get the tears\\nBut the ceremony of the bells and lace\\nStill veils this reckless fool here Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink\\nCircling in singles and in pairs\\nIn this vigorous anonymity\\nA blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares\\nAnd the power of reason\\nAnd the flowers of deep feeling\\nSeem to serve me\\nOnly to deceive me Sharon you've got a husband\\nAnd a family and a farm\\nI've got the apple of temptation\\nAnd a diamond snake around my arm\\nBut you still have your music\\nAnd I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky\\nYou sing for your friends and your family\\nI'll walk green pastures by and by Again and again the same situation\\nFor so many years\\nTethered to a ringing telephone\\nIn a room full to mirrors\\nA pretty girl in your bathroom\\nChecking out her sex appeal\\nI asked myself when you said you loved me\\n\\\"Do you think this can be real?\\\" Still, I sent up my prayer\\nWondering where it had to go\\nWith heaven full of astronauts\\nAnd the Lord on death row\\nWhile the millions of his lost and lonely ones\\nCall out and glamour to be found\\nCaught in their struggle for higher positions\\nAnd their search for love that sticks around You've had lots of lovely women\\nNow you turn your gaze to me\\nWeighing the beauty and the imperfection\\nTo see if I'm worthy\\nLike the church\\nLike a cop\\nLike a mother\\nYou want me to be truthful\\nSometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though\\nAnd I need your approval Still, I sent up my prayer\\nWondering who was there to hear\\nI said \\\"Send me somebody\\nWho's strong, and somewhat sincere\\\"\\nWith the millions of the lost and lonely ones\\nI called out to be released\\nCaught in my struggle for higher achievements\\nAnd my search for love\\nThat don't seem to cease Look out the left the captain said\\nThe lights down there, that's where we'll land\\nI saw a falling star burn up\\nAbove the Las Vegas sands\\nIt wasn't the one that you gave to me\\nThat night down south between the trailers\\nNot the early one\\nThat you can wish upon,\\nNot the northern one\\nThat guides in the sailors Oh star bright, star bright\\nYou've got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't have got on this flight tonight You got the touch so gentle and sweet\\nBut you've got that look so critical\\nNow I can't talk to you baby\\nI get so weak\\nSometimes I think love is just mythical\\nUp there's a heaven\\nDown there's a town\\nBlackness everywhere and little lights shine\\nOh, blackness, blackness dragging me down\\nCome on light the candle in this poor heart of mine Oh star bright, star bright\\nYou've got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight I'm drinking sweet champagne\\nGot the headphones up high\\nCan't numb you out\\nCan't drum you out of my mind\\nThey're playing, Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,\\nOoh, ooh, love is blind Up go the flaps, down go the wheels\\nI hope you got your heat turned on baby\\nI hope they finally fixed your automobile\\nI hope it's better when we meet again baby Star bright, star bright\\nYou got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't have got on this flight tonight There's a man who's been out sailing\\nIn a decade full of dreams\\nAnd he takes her to a schooner\\nAnd he treats her like a queen\\nBearing beads from California\\nWith their amber stones and green\\nHe has called her from the harbor\\nHe has kissed her with his freedom\\nHe has heard her off to starboard\\nIn the breaking and the breathing\\nOf the water weeds\\nWhile she was busy being free There's a man who's climbed a mountain\\nAnd he's calling out her name\\nAnd he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles\\nHe calls again\\nHe can think her there beside him\\nHe can miss her just the same\\nHe has missed her in the forest\\nWhile he showed her all the flowers\\nAnd the branches sang the chorus\\nAs he climbed the scaley towers\\nOf a forest tree\\nWhile she was somewhere being free There's a man who's sent a letter\\nAnd he's waiting for reply\\nHe has asked her of her travels\\nSince the day they said goodbye\\nHe writes \\\"Wish you were beside me\\nWe can make it if we try\\\"\\nHe has seen her at the office\\nWith her name on all his papers\\nThrough the sharing of the profits\\nHe will find it hard to shake her\\nFrom his memory\\nAnd she's so busy being free There's a lady in the city\\nAnd she thinks she loves them all\\nThere's the one who's thinking of her\\nThere's the one who sometimes calls\\nThere's the one who writes her letters\\nWith his facts and figures scrawl\\nShe has brought them to her senses\\nThey have laughed inside her laughter\\nNow she rallies her defenses\\nFor she fears that one will ask her\\nFor eternity\\nAnd she's so busy being free There's a man who sends her medals\\nHe is bleeding from the war\\nThere's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store\\nThere's a drummer and a dreamer\\nAnd you know there may be more\\nShe will love them when she sees them\\nThey will lose her if they follow\\nAnd she only means to please them\\nAnd her heart is full and hollow\\nLike a cactus tree\\nWhile she's so busy being free I pulled up behind a Cadillac\\nWe were waiting for the light\\nAnd I took a look at his license plate\\nIt said, \\\"Just Ice\\\"\\nIs justice just ice?\\nGoverned by greed and lust?\\nJust the strong doing what they can\\nAnd the weak suffering what they must?\\nOh, and the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nSex kills Doctors' pills give you brand new ills\\nAnd the bills bury you like an avalanche\\nAnd lawyers haven't been this popular\\nSince Robespierre slaughtered half of France!\\nAnd Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know\\nThe balance is undone, crazy ions\\nYou can feel it out in traffic\\nEveryone hates everyone\\nAnd the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nSex kills All these jack-offs at the office\\nThe rapist in the pool\\nOh, and the tragedies in the nurseries\\nLittle kids packin' guns to school\\nThe ulcerated ozone\\nThese tumors of the skin\\nThis hostile sun beating down on\\nMassive mess we're in\\nAnd the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nAnd sex kills\\nSex kills\\nSex kills\\nOh, sex kills\\nSex kills He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel\\nHe was drinking for diversion\\nHe was thinking for himself\\nA little money riding on the Maple Leafs\\nAlong comes a lady in lacy sleeves\\nShe says let me sit down\\nYou know, drinkin' alone's a shame (It's a shame it's a crying shame)\\nLook at those jokers\\nGlued to that damn hockey game\\nHey honey-you've got lots of cash\\nBring us round a bottle\\nAnd we'll have some laughs\\nGin's what I'm drinking\\nI was raised on robbery I'm a pretty good cook\\nSitting on my groceries\\nCome up to my kitchen\\nI'll show you my best recipe\\nI try and I try but I can't save a cent\\nI'm up after midnight, cooking\\nTrying to make my rent\\nI'm rough but I'm pleasin'\\nI was raised on robbery We had a little money once\\nThey were pushing through a four lane highway\\nGovernment gave us three thousand dollars\\nYou should have seen it fly away\\nFirst he bought a '57 Biscayne\\nHe put it in the ditch\\nHe drunk up all the rest\\nThat son of a bitch\\nHis blood's bad whiskey\\nI was raised on robbery You know you ain't bad looking\\nI like the way you hold your drinks\\nCome home with me, honey\\nI ain't asking for no full length mink\\nHey, where you going\\nDon't go yet\\nYour glass ain't empty and we just met\\nYou're mean when your loaded\\nI was raised on robbery My old man he's a singer in the park\\nHe's a walker in the rain\\nHe's a dancer in the dark\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied and true no, my old man\\nKeeping away my blues He's my sunshine in the morning\\nHe's my fireworks at the end of the day\\nHe's the warmest chord I ever heard\\nPlay that warm chord, play and stay baby\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied and true, my old man\\nKeeping away my blues But when he's gone\\nMe and them lonesome blues collide\\nThe bed's too big\\nThe frying pan's too wide Then he comes home\\nAnd he takes me in his loving arms\\nAnd he tells me all his troubles\\nAnd he tells me all my charms\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,\\nAnd he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday\\nCynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe\\nYou laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes\\nThey're full of moon\\nYou like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you\\nAll those pretty lies, pretty lies\\nWhen you gonna realize they're only pretty lies\\nOnly pretty lies, just pretty lies He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed\\nThree buttons and the thing began to whirr\\nAnd a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie\\nAnd she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close\\nRichard, you haven't really changed, I said\\nIt's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head\\nYou got tombs in your eyes, but the songs\\nYou punched are dreaming\\nListen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet\\nWhen you gonna get yourself back on your feet?\\nOh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet Richard got married to a figure skater\\nAnd he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator\\nAnd he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on\\nAnd all the house lights left up bright\\nI'm gonna blow this damn candle out\\nI don't want Nobody comin' over to my table\\nI got nothing to talk to anybody about\\nAll good dreamers pass this way some day\\nHidin' behind bottles in dark cafes\\nDark cafes\\nOnly a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings\\nAnd fly away\\nOnly a phase, these dark cafe days When Charlie speaks of Lester\\nYou know someone great has gone\\nThe sweetest swinging music man\\nHad a Porkie Pig hat on\\nA bright star\\nIn a dark age\\nWhen the bandstands had a thousand ways\\nOf refusing a black man admission\\nBlack musician\\nIn those days they put him in an\\nUnderdog position\\nCellars and chittlins' When Lester took him a wife\\nArm and arm went black and white\\nAnd some saw red\\nAnd drove them from their hotel bed\\nLove is never easy\\nIt's short of the hope we have for happiness\\nBright and sweet\\nLove is never easy street!\\nNow we are black and white\\nEmbracing out in the lunatic New York night\\nIt's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town\\nOr be hung in a tree\\nThat's unlikely! Tonight these crowds\\nAre happy and loud\\nChildren are up dancing in the streets\\nIn the sticky middle of the night\\nSummer serenade\\nOf taxi horns and fun arcades\\nWhere right or wrong\\nUnder neon\\nEvery feeling goes on!\\nFor you and me\\nThe sidewalk is a history book\\nAnd a circus\\nDangerous clowns\\nBalancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions\\nThey have been handed\\nDay by day\\nGenerations on down We came up from the subway\\nOn the music midnight makes\\nTo Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone\\nIn taxi horns and brakes\\nNow Charlie's down in Mexico\\nWith the healers\\nSo the sidewalk leads us with music\\nTo two little dancers\\nDancing outside a black bar\\nThere's a sign up on the awning\\nIt says \\\"Pork Pie Hat Bar\\\"\\nAnd there's black babies dancing\\nTonight! Don't interrupt the sorrow\\nDarn right\\nIn flames our prophet witches\\nBe polite\\nA room full of glasses\\nHe says \\\"Your notches liberation doll\\\"\\nAnd he chains me with that serpent\\nTo that Ethiopian wall Anima rising\\nQueen of Queens\\nWash my guilt of Eden\\nWash and balance me\\nAnima rising\\nUprising in me tonight\\nShe's a vengeful little goddess\\nWith an ancient crown to fight Truth goes up in vapors\\nThe steeples lean\\nWinds of change patriarchs\\nSnug in your bible belt dreams\\nGod goes up the chimney\\nLike childhood Santa Claus\\nThe good slaves love the good book\\nA rebel loves a cause I'm leaving on the 1:15\\nYou're darn right\\nSince I was seventeen\\nI've had no one over me\\nHe says \\\"Anima rising-\\nSo what-\\nPetrified wood process\\nTall timber down to rock!\\\" Don't interrupt the sorrow\\nDarn right\\nHe says \\\"We walked on the moon\\nYou be polite.\\\"\\nDon't let up the sorrow\\nDeath and birth and death and birth\\nHe says \\\"Bring that bottle kindly\\nAnd I'll pad your purse-\\nI've got a head full of quandary\\nAnd a mighty, mighty, thirst.\\\" Seventeen glasses\\nRhine wine\\nMilk of the Madonna\\nClandestine\\nHe don't let up the sorrow\\nHe lies and he cheats\\nIt takes a heart like Mary's these days\\nWhen your man gets weak Varnished weeds in window jars\\nTarnished beads on tapestries\\nKept in satin boxes are\\nReflections of love's memories Letters from across the seas\\nRoses dipped in sealing wax\\nValentines and maple leaves\\nTucked into a paperback Guess I'll throw them all away\\nI found someone to love today Dark with darker moods is he\\nNot a golden Prince who's come\\nThrough columbines and wizardry\\nTo talk of castles in the sun Still I'll take a chance and see\\nI found someone to love today There's a sorrow in his eyes\\nLike the angel made of tin\\nWhat will happen if I try\\nTo place another heart in him In a Bleeker Street cafe\\nI found someone to love today\\nI found someone to love today I am a woman of heart and mind\\nWith time on her hands\\nNo child to raise\\nYou come to me like a little boy\\nAnd I give you my scorn and my praise\\nYou think I'm like your mother\\nOr another lover or your sister\\nOr the queen of your dreams\\nOr just another silly girl\\nWhen love makes a fool of me After the rush when you come back down\\nYou're always disappointed\\nNothing seems to keep you high\\nDrive your bargains\\nPush your papers\\nWin your medals\\nFuck your strangers\\nDon't it leave you on the empty side\\nI'm looking for affection and respect\\nA little passion\\nAnd you want stimulation-nothing more\\nThat's what I think\\nBut you know I'll try to be there for you\\nWhen your spirits start to sink All this talk about holiness now\\nIt must be the start of the latest style\\nIs it all books and words\\nOr do you really feel it?\\nDo you really laugh?\\nDo you really care?\\nDo you really smile\\nWhen you smile?\\nYou criticize and you flatter\\nYou imitate the best\\nAnd the rest you memorize\\nYou know the times you impress me most\\nAre the times when you don't try\\nWhen you don't even try A strange boy is weaving\\nA course of grace and havoc\\nOn a yellow skateboard\\nThrough midday sidewalk traffic\\nJust when I think he's foolish and childish\\nAnd I want him to be manly\\nI catch my fool and my child\\nNeeding love and understanding What a strange, strange boy\\nHe still lives with his family\\nEven the war and the navy\\nCouldn't bring him to maturity He keeps referring back to school days\\nAnd clinging to his child\\nFidgeting and bullied\\nHis crazy wisdom holding onto something wild\\nHe asked me to be patient\\nWell I failed\\n\\\"Grow up!\\\" I cried\\nAnd as, the smoke was clearing he said\\n\\\"Give me one good reason why!\\\" What a strange, strange boy\\nHe sees the cars as sets of waves\\nSequences of mass and space\\nHe sees the damage in my face We got high on travel\\nAnd we got drunk on alcohol\\nAnd on love the strongest poison and medicine of all\\nSee how that feeling comes and goes\\nLike the pull of moon on tides\\nNow I am surf rising\\nNow parched ribs of sand at his side What a strange, strange boy\\nI gave him clothes and jewelry\\nI gave him my warm body\\nI gave him power over me A thousand glass eyes were staring\\nIn a cellar full of antique dolls\\nI found an old piano\\nAnd sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls\\nWhile the boarders were snoring\\nUnder crisp white sheets of curfew\\nWe were newly lovers then\\nWe were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter\\nI came out two days on your tail\\nThose two bald-headed days in November\\nBefore the first snowflakes sail\\nOut on the vast and subtle plains of mystery\\nA split tongue spirit talks\\nNoble as a nickel chief\\nStriking up an old juke box\\nAnd he says:\\n\\\"Snakes along the railroad tracks.\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Eagles in jet trails\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Coils around feathers and talons on scales\\nGravel under the belly plates\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Wind in the Wings\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Big bird dragging its tail in the dust\\nSnake kite flying on a string.\\\" I come from open prairie\\nGiven some wisdom and a lot of jive!\\nLast night the ghosts of my old ideas\\nReran on channel five\\nAnd it howled so spooky for its eagle soul\\nI nearly broke down and cried\\nBut the split tongue spirit laughed at me\\nHe says, \\\"Your serpent cannot be denied.\\\"\\nOur serpents love the whisky bars\\nThey love the romance of the crime\\nBut didn't I see a neon sign\\nFester on your hotel blind\\nAnd a country road come off the wall\\nAnd swoop down at the crowd at the bar\\nAnd put me at the top of your danger list\\nJust for being so much like you are! You're a coward against the altitude\\nYou're a coward against the flesh\\nCoward, caught between yes and no\\nReckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!\\nReckless brazen in the play\\nOf your changing traffic lights\\nCoward, slinking down the hall\\nto another restless night\\nAs we center behind the eight ball\\nAs we rock between the sheets\\nAs we siphon the colored language\\nOff the farms and the streets\\nHere in Good-Old-God-Save-America\\nthe home of the brave and the free\\nWe are all hopelessly oppressed cowards\\nOf some duality\\nOf restless multiplicity\\n(Oh say can you see) Restless for streets and honky tonks\\nRestless for home and routine\\nRestless for country-safety-and her\\nRestless for the likes of reckless me\\nRestless sweeps like fire and rain\\nOver virgin wilderness\\nIt prowls like hookers and thieves\\nThrough bolt locked tenements\\nBehind my bolt locked door\\nThe eagle and the serpent are at war in me\\nThe serpent fighting for blind desire\\nThe eagle for clarity\\nWhat strange prizes these battles bring\\nThese hectic joys-these weary blues\\nPuffed up and strutting when I think I win\\nDown and shaken when I think I lose\\nThere are rivets up here in this eagle\\nThere are box cars down there on your snake\\nAnd we are twins of spirit\\nNo matter which route home we take\\nOr what we forsake\\nWe're going to come up to the eyes of clarity\\nAnd we'll go down to the beads of guile\\nThere is danger and education\\nIn living out such a reckless life style\\nI touched you on the central plains\\nIt was plane to train my twin\\nIt was just plane shadow to train shadow\\nBut to me it was skin to skin\\nThe spirit talks in spectrums\\nHe talks to mother earth to father sky\\nSelf indulgence to self denial\\nMan

kind person\\nYou're a cold person too\\nIt's down to you You go down to the pick up station\\nCraving warmth and beauty\\nYou settle for less than fascination\\nA few drinks later you're not so choosy\\nWhen the closing lights strip off the shadows\\nOn this strange new flesh you've found\\nClutching the night to you like a fig leaf\\nYou hurry\\nTo the blackness\\nAnd the blankets\\nTo lay down an impression\\nAnd your loneliness In the morning there are lovers in the street\\nThey look so high\\nYou brush against a stranger\\nAnd you both apologize\\nOld friends seem indifferent\\nYou must have brought that on\\nOld bonds have broken down\\nLove is gone\\nOoh, love is gone\\nWritten on your spirit this sad song\\nLove is gone Everything comes and goes\\nPleasure moves on too early\\nAnd trouble leaves too slow\\nJust when you're thinking\\nYou've finally got it made\\nBad news comes knocking\\nAt your garden gate\\nKnocking for you\\nConstant stranger\\nYou're a brute, you're an angel\\nYou can crawl, you can fly too\\nIt's down to you\\nIt all comes down to you I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town\\nIt hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down\\nWhen the sun turns traitor cold\\nand all trees are shivering in a naked row\\nI get the urge for going but I never seem to go\\nI get the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in\\nI had me a man in summertime\\nHe had summer-colored skin\\nAnd not another girl in town\\nMy darling's heart could win\\nBut when the leaves fell on the ground\\nAnd bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow\\nHe got the urge for going and I had to let him go\\nHe got the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass was turning brown And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in\\nNow the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout\\nAnd all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out\\nSee the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow\\nThey've got the urge for going and they've got the wings so they can go\\nThey get the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in\\nI'll ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin\\nI'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll bolt my wandering in\\nI'd like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so\\nBut she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go\\nShe get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown\\nAnd all her empires are falling down\\nAnd winter's closing in\\nAnd I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown\\nAnd summertime is falling down The story hit the news\\nFrom coast to coast\\nThey said you beat the girl\\nYou loved the most\\nYour charitable acts\\nSeemed out of place\\nWith the beauty\\nWith your fist marks on her face\\nYour buddies all stood by\\nThey bet their\\nFortunes and their fame\\nThat she was out of line\\nAnd you were not to blame Six hundred thousand doctors\\nAre putting on rubber gloves\\nAnd they're poking\\nAt the miseries made of love\\nThey say they're learning\\nHow to spot\\nThe battered wives\\nAmong all the women\\nThey see bleeding through their lives\\nI bleed\\nFor your perversity\\nThese red words that make a stain\\nOn your white-washed claim that\\nShe was out of line\\nAnd you were not to blame I heard your baby say\\nWhen he was only three\\n\\\"Daddy, let's get some girls\\nOne for you and one for me\\\"\\nHis mother had the frailty\\nYou despise\\nAnd the looks you love\\nTo drive to suicide\\nNot one wet eye around her\\nLonely little grave\\nSaid \\\"He was out of line, girl\\nYou were not to blame\\\" When morning comes to Morgantown\\nThe merchants roll their awnings down\\nThe milktrucks make their morning rounds\\nIn morning, Morgantown We'll

denied\\n\\\"Heart and humor and humility\\\"\\nHe said \\\"Will lighten up your heavy load\\\"\\nI left him for the refuge of the roads I fell in with some drifters\\nCast upon a beach town\\nWinn

the Gulf of Mexico\\nThey were overflowing in the refuge of the roads There was spring along the ditches\\nThere were good times in the cities\\nOh, radiant happiness\\nIt was all so light and easy\\nTill I started analyzing\\nAnd I brought on my old ways\\nA thunderhead of judgment was\\nGathering in my gaze\\nAnd it made most people nervous\\nThey just didn't want to know\\nWhat I was seeing in the refuge of the roads I pulled off into a forest\\nCrickets clicking in the ferns\\nLike a wheel of fortune\\nI heard my fate turn, turn turn\\nAnd I went running down a white sand

ball\\nOr a forest or a highway\\nOr me here least of all\\nYou couldn't see these cold water restrooms\\nOr this baggage overload\\nWestbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads Turning and turning\\nWithin the widening gyre\\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer\\nThings fall apart\\nThe center cannot hold\\nAnd a blood dimmed tide\\nIs loosed upon the world Nothing is sacred\\nThe

poor drunk bastard falls\\nIn the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years\\nYou think we're sleeping--but\\nQuietly like rattlesnakes and stars\\nWe have seen the trampled rainbows\\nIn the smoke of cars [Chorus]\\nI am Lakota\\nBrave\\nSun pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nBroken\\nMoon pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nGrave\\nShadows stretching\\nLakota\\nOh pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nWeak\\nGrass pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nFaithful\\nRocks pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nMeek\\nStanding water\\nLakota\\nOh pity me I am Lakota!\\nLakota!\\nStanding on sacred land\\nWe never sold these Black Hills\\nTo the missile-heads,\\nTo the power plants\\nWe want the land!\\nThe bullet and the fence, broke Lakota\\nThe black coats and the booze, broke Lakota\\nCourts that circumvent, choke Lakota\\nNothing left to lose\\nTell me grandfather\\nYou spoke the fur and feather tongues,\\nDo you hear the whimpering waters\\nWhen the tractors come? [Chorus] Sun pity me\\nMother earth\\nMother\\nMoon pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nShadows\\nStretching on the forest floor\\nMother earth\\nOh pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nGrass pity me\\nMother earth\\nMother\\nRocks pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nWater\\nStanding in a waken manner\\nMother earth\\nOh pity me I heard it in the wind last night\\nIt sounded like applause\\nDid you get a round resounding for you\\nWay up here\\nSeems like many dim years ago\\nSince I heard that face to face\\nSo seen you face to face\\nThough tonight I can feel you here\\nI get these notes\\nOn butterflies and lilac sprays\\nFrom girls who just have to tell me\\nThey saw you somewhere In some office sits a poet\\nAnd he trembles as he sings\\nAnd he asks some guy\\nTo circulate his soul around\\nOn your mark red ribbon runner\\nThe caressing rev of motors\\nFinely tuned like fancy women\\nIn Thirties evening gowns\\nUp the charts\\nOff to the airport\\nYour name's in the news\\nEverything's first class\\nThe lights go down\\nAnd it's just you up there\\nGetting them to feel like that Remember the days when you used to sit\\nAnd make up your tunes for love\\nAnd pour your simple sorrow\\nTo the sound hole and your knee\\nAnd now you're seen\\nOn giant screens\\nAnd at parties for the press\\nAnd for people who have slices of you\\nFrom the company\\nThey toss around your latest golden egg\\nSpeculation-well, who's to know\\nIf the next one in the nest\\nWill glitter for them so I guess I seem ungrateful\\nWith my teeth sunk in the hand\\nThat brings me things\\nI really can't give up just yet\\nNow I sit up here\\nThe critic!\\nAnd they introduce some band\\nBut they seem so much confetti\\nLooking at them on my TV set\\nOh the power and the glory\\nJust when you're getting a taste for worship\\nThey start bringing out the hammers\\nAnd the boards\\nAnd the nails I heard it in the wind last night\\nIt sounded like applause\\nChilly now\\nEnd of summer\\nNo more shiny hot nights\\nIt was just the arbutus rustling\\nAnd the bumping of the logs\\nAnd the moon swept down black water\\nLike an empty spotlight Once in a while\\nIn a big blue moon\\nThere comes a night like this\\nLike some surrealist\\nInvented this fourth of July\\nNight ride home Hula girls\\nAnd caterpillar tractors in the sand\\nThe ukulele man\\nThe fireworks\\nThis 4th of July\\nNight ride home I love the man beside me\\nWe love the open road\\nNo phones till Friday\\nFar from the overkill\\nFar from the overload Back at the bar\\nThe band tears down\\nBut out here in the headlight beams\\nThe silver power lines\\nGleam\\nOn this fourth of July\\nNight ride home Round the curve\\nAnd a big dark horse\\nRed taillights on his hide\\nIs keeping right alongside\\nRev for stride\\nFourth of July\\nNight ride home I love the man beside me\\nWe love the open road\\nNo phones till Friday\\nFar from the undertow\\nFar from the overload Once in awhile\\nIn a big blue moon\\nThere comes a night like this\\nLike some surrealist\\nInvented this fourth of July\\nNight ride home\\nNight ride home\\nNight ride home\\nOn a night ride home\\nOn a night ride home\\nNight ride home Although I speak in tongues\\nOf men and angels\\nI'm just sounding brass\\nAnd tinkling cymbals without love- Love suffers long-\\nLove is kind!-\\nEnduring all things-\\nLove has no evil in mind If I had the gift of prophecy-\\nAnd all the knowledge-\\nAnd the faith to move the mountains\\nEven if I understood all of the mysteries-\\nIf I didn't have love\\nI'd be nothing Love-never looks for love-\\nLove's not puffed up-\\nOr envious-\\nOr touchy-\\nBecause it rejoices in the truth\\nNot in iniquity\\nLove sees like a child sees As a child I spoke as a child-\\nI thought and I understood as a child-\\nBut when I became a woman-\\nI put away childish things\\nAnd began to see through a glass darkly Where, as a child, I saw it face to face\\nNow, I only know it in part\\nFractions in me\\nOf faith and hope and love\\nAnd of these great three\\nLove's the greatest beauty\\nLove\\nLove\\nLove I was in an all night movie\\nWhen I heard the usher say\\nHere comes the midnight cowboy\\nGot his gun hired out for pay;\\nYou were walking kind of faded\\nFrom the netherlands hotel\\nWith your hat tipped off to ladies\\nReally looking well. Aw joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you falling down\\nGet out of town. Well you came to new york city with a calendar full of gold\\nNow they locked it up in the bedroom\\nAnd they kicked you out in the cold;\\nNow you can't afford a little blanket\\nYou can get one from a friend\\nYou can trick one off the corner\\nYou can even keep the change - to spend. Hey joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you come falling down\\nGet out of town. There's a soldier in the depot\\nHe's a fighting nightingale\\nWearing western boots and buckskin on\\nReading fortunes from the penny scale;\\nNow today he's got a a quarter\\nFor the photograph machine\\nBut tomorrow he'll be lonely lonely\\nThat's the way it's always been. Poor joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you falling down\\nGet out of town. I was in an all night movie\\nWhen I heard the usher say\\nHere comes the midnight cowboy again\\nGot his gun hired out for pay;\\nYou were walking kind of faded\\nFrom the netherlands hotel\\nHat tipped off to ladies\\nTipped off to gentlemen as well. Well joe, why don't you go back home?\\nFind yourself a girl and settle down\\nGet out of town\\nGet out of town\\nFind yourself a girl, go and settle down\\nHey joe, looking more lost than found\\nGet out of town. I was an unmarried girl\\nI'd just turned twenty-seven\\nWhen they sent me to the sisters\\nFor the way men looked at me\\nBranded as a Jezebel\\nI knew I was not bound for Heaven\\nI'd be cast in shame\\nInto the Magdalene laundries Most girls come here pregnant\\nSome by their own fathers\\nBridget got that belly by her parish priest\\nWe're trying to get things white as snow\\nAll of us woe-begotten-daughters\\nIn the streaming stains\\nOf the Magdalene laundries Prostitutes and destitutes\\nAnd temptresses like me\\nFallen women\\nSentenced into dreamless drudgery\\nWhy do they call this heartless place\\nOur Lady of Charity?\\nOh charity! These bloodless brides of Jesus\\nIf they had just once glimpsed their groom\\nThen they'd know, and they'd drop the stones\\nConcealed behind their rosaries\\nThey wilt the grass they walk upon\\nThey leech the light out of a room\\nThey'd like to drive us down the drain\\nAt the Magdalene laundries Peg O'Connell died today\\nShe was a cheeky girl\\nA flirt\\nThey just stuffed her in a hole!\\nSurely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!\\nOne day I'm going to die here too\\nAnd they'll plant me in the dirt\\nLike some lame bulb\\nThat never blooms, come any spring\\nNot any spring Up in a sterilized room\\nWhere they let you be lazy\\nKnowing your attitude's all wrong\\nAnd you got to change\\nAnd that's not easy\\nDragon shining with all values known\\nDazzling you, keeping you from your own\\nWhere is the lion in you to defy him\\nWhen you're this weak\\nAnd this spacey So what are you going to do about it\\nYou can't live life and you can't leave it\\nAdvice and religion, you can't take it\\nYou can't seem to believe it\\nThe peacock is afraid to parade\\nYou're under the thumb of the maid\\nYou really can't give love in this condition\\nStill you know how you need it They open and close you\\nThen they talk like they know you\\nThey don't know you\\nThey're friends and they're foes, too\\nTrouble child\\nBreaking like the waves at Malibu So why does it come as such a shock?\\nTo know you really have no one\\nOnly a river of changing faces\\nLooking for an ocean\\nThey trickle through your leaky plans\\nAnother dream over the dam\\nAnd you're lying in some room\\nFeeling like your right to be human\\nIs going over too\\nWell, some are going to knock you\\nAnd some'll try to clock you\\nYou know it's really hard\\nTo talk sense to you\\nTrouble child\\nBreaking like the waves at Malibu Play, little david\\nPlay little david, play David he would sit in some dark corner\\nSeemed to melt the shadows with his eyes\\nAnd the song that he was playing\\nWas nothing less than prayin'\\nAnd nothing more than sayin' \\\"i'm alive.\\\"\\nWon't you play, little david\\nPlay little david, play David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I don't need no sunday sermon\\nNeed no sunday shoes\\nWhen I hear little david playing\\nI got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I don't need no sunday sermon\\nNeed no sunday shoes\\nWhen I hear little david playing\\nI got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear Won't you play, little david, play little david, play\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I had a king in a tenement castle\\nLately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown\\nHe's taken the curtains down\\nHe's swept with the broom of contempt\\nAnd the rooms have an empty ring\\nHe's cleaned with the tears\\nOf an actor who fears for the laughter's sting- [Chorus]\\nI can't go back there anymore\\nYou know my keys won't fit the door\\nYou know my thoughts don't fit the man\\nThey never can they never can I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley\\nLately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind\\nHe lives in another time\\nLadies in gingham still blush\\nWhile he sings them of wars and wine\\nBut I in my leather and lace\\nI can never become that kind [Chorus] I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage\\nWho carried me off to his country for marriage too soon\\nBeware of the power of moons\\nThere's no one to blame\\nNo there's no one to name as a traitor here\\nThe king's on the road\\nAnd the queen's in the grove till the end of the year- [Chorus] Who has seen the wind\\nScalloping the sea\\nOr gliding like a swallow\\nOver villages and trees? \\\"I have\\\", said the willow\\nAnd I begged him please to stay\\nBut he went away\\nHe went on his own one day And I sing, \\\"One love have I\\\"\\nAnd he sings \\\"Now it's goodbye\\\"\\nAnd I sing, \\\"Part of me dies\\nUntil I see you again\\\" Who has seen the sun\\nThrough a parasol of leaves\\nThrough scattered ruby cloud fires\\nThrough the silver wings of bees \\\"I have\\\", said the waters\\nAnd I held his face to mine\\nBut he left in time\\nHe went in his own good time Who has seen the stranger\\nIn a coat of simple brown\\nWith his face of many faces\\nWith his eyes turned out of town I have, and I kissed him\\nAnd I begged him please to stay\\nBut he went away\\nWith the sun and the wind away Where to begin to end uncertainty\\nDo I leave silently or boldly say farewell\\nHow can I think of times that used to be\\nAnd find the smile I need to wish you well But I won't cry for dusty memories\\nNo I won't cry for dreams that couldn't be\\nNo I won't cry The daffodils, the sorry candlelight\\nTo buy my heart when loveless words were spoken\\nToo many tears to welcome in the night\\nToo many promises the days have broken So I won't cry for kisses out of reach\\nNo I won't cry Ill practice what I preach\\nAnd I won't cry No flowers now, no silly candle games\\nSomehow my feet won't lead me to the doorway\\nAnd so I stand and wonder who's to blame\\nWaiting for one last word that calls to beg me stay But I won't cry if that world never comes\\nNo I won't cry for now the story's done\\nAnd I won't cry, goodbye Cold blue steel out of money\\nOne eye for the beat police\\nSweet fire calling\\n\\\"You can't deny me\\nNow you know what you need\\\"\\nUnderneath the jungle gym\\nHollow-grey-fire-escape-thief\\nLooking for sweet fire\\nShadow of Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me\\nI know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you want to contact somebody first\\nLeave someone a letter\\nYou can come now\\nOr you can come later\\\" A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer\\nEdgy-black cracks of the sky\\n\\\"Pin-cushion-prick-\\nFix this poor bad dreamer!\\\"\\n\\\"Money\\\" cold shadows reply\\nPawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked\\nCorridors spit on prayers and pleas\\nSparks fly up from sweet fire\\nBlack soot of Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me\\nI know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you wanna contact somebody first\\nDoes it really matter\\nIf you come now\\nOr if you come on later?\\\" Red water in the bathroom sink\\nFever and the scum brown bowl\\nBlue Steel still begging\\nBut it's indistinct\\nSomeone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll\\nConcrete concentration camp\\nBashing in veins for peace\\nCold blue steel and sweet fire\\nFall into Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me I know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you wanna contact somebody first\\nI mean what does it really matter\\nYou're gonna come now\\nOr you're gonna come later\\\" Downtown\\nMy darling dime store thief\\nIn the War of Independence\\nRock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory\\nUnder neon signs\\nA girl was in bloom\\nAnd a woman was fading\\nIn a suburban room\\nI said, \\\"Take me to the dance\\\"\\n\\\"Do you want to dance?\\\"\\n\\\"I love to dance\\\"\\nAnd I told him, \\\"They don't take chances\\nThey seem so removed from romance\\\"\\n\\\"They've been broken in churches and schools\\nAnd molded to middle class circumstance\\\"\\nAnd we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling Downtown\\nThe dance halls and cafes\\nFeel so wild you could break somebody's heart\\nJust doing the latest dance craze\\nGail and Louise\\nIn those push-up brassieres\\nTight dresses and rhinestone rings\\nDrinking up the band's beers\\nYoung love was kissing under bridges\\nKissing in cars, kissing in cafes\\nAnd we were walking down Main Street\\nKisses like bright flags hung on holidays\\n\\\"In France they kiss on Main Street\\\"\\n\\\"Amour, mama, not cheap display\\\"\\nAnd we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling Downtown\\nIn the pinball arcade\\nWith his head full of pool hall pitches\\nAnd songs from the hit parade\\nHe'd be singing \\\"Bye, Bye, Love\\\"\\nWhile he's racking up his free play\\nLet those rock 'n roll choir boys\\nCome and carry us away\\nSometimes Chickie had the car\\nOr Ron had a car\\nOr Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head\\nWe'd all go looking for a party\\nLooking to raise Jesus up from the dead\\nAnd I'd be kissing in the back seat\\nThrilling to the Brando-like things that he said\\nAnd we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling He bought her a diamond for her throat\\nHe put her in a ranch house on a hill\\nShe could see the valley barbecues\\nFrom her window sill\\nSee the blue pools in the squinting sun\\nHear the hissing of summer lawns He put up a barbed wire fence\\nTo keep out the unknown\\nAnd on every metal thorn\\nJust a little blood of his own\\nShe patrols that fence of his\\nTo a Latin drum\\nAnd the hissing of summer lawns\\nDarkness\\nWonder makes it easy\\nDarkness\\nWith a joyful mask\\nDarkness\\nTube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness\\nNo color no contrast A diamond dog\\nCarrying a cup and a cane\\nLooking through a double glass\\nLooking at too much pride and too much shame\\nThere's a black fly buzzing\\nThere's a heat wave burning in her master's voice\\nHissing summer lawns He gave her his darkness to regret\\nAnd good reason to quit him\\nHe gave her a roomful of Chippendale\\nThat nobody sits in\\nStill she stays with a love of some kind\\nIt's the lady's choice\\nThe hissing of summer lawns There's a crow flying\\nBlack and ragged\\nTree to tree\\nHe's black as the highway that's leading me\\nNow he's diving down\\nTo pick up on something shiny\\nI feel like that black crow\\nFlying\\nIn a blue sky I took a ferry to the highway\\nThen I drove to a pontoon plane\\nI took a plane to a taxi\\nAnd a taxi to a train\\nI've been traveling so long\\nHow's I ever going to know my home\\nWhen I see it again\\nI'm like a black crow flying\\nIn a blue, blue sky In search of love and music\\nMy whole life has been\\nIllumination\\nCorruption\\nAnd diving, diving, diving, diving.\\nDiving down to pick up on every shiny thing\\nJust like that black crow flying\\nIn a blue sky I looked at the morning\\nAfter being up all night\\nI looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light\\nI looked out the window\\nAnd I saw that ragged soul take flight\\nI saw a back crow flying\\nIn a blue sky\\nOh I'm like a black crow flying\\nIn a blue sky I'm always running behind the time\\nJust like this train\\nShaking into town\\nWith the brakes complaining I used to count lovers like railroad cars\\nI counted them on my side\\nLately I don't count on nothing\\nI just let things slide The station master's shuffling cards\\nBoxcars are banging in the yards\\nJealous lovin'll make you crazy\\nIf you can't find your goodness\\n'Cause you lost your heart I went looking for a cause\\nOr a strong cat without claws\\nOr any reason to resume\\nAnd I found this empty seat\\nIn this crowded waiting room (Everybody waiting)\\nOld man sleeping on his bags\\nWomen with that teased up kind of hair\\nKids with the jitters in their legs\\nAnd those wide, wide open stares\\nAnd the kids got cokes and chocolate bars\\nThere's a thin man smoking a fat cigar\\nJealous lovin'll make you crazy\\nIf you can't find your goodness\\n'Cause you've lost your heart What are you going to do now\\nYou've got no one\\nTo give your love too Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind\\nI've got this fold up sink\\nAnd these rocks and these cactus going by\\nAnd a bottle of German wine to drink\\nSettle down into the clickety-clack\\nWith the clouds and the stars to read\\nDreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have\\nWatching your hairline recede, my vain darling\\nWatching your hair and clouds and stars\\nI'm rocking away in a sleeping car\\nThis jealous lovin's bound to make me\\nCrazy\\nI can't find my goodness\\nI lost my heart\\nOh, sour grapes\\nBecause I lost my heart Down in the cellar in the Boho zone\\nI went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well\\nJust another hard-time band\\nWith Negro affectations\\nI was a hopeful in rooms like this\\nWhen I was working cheap\\nIt's an old romance-the Boho dance\\nIt hasn't gone to sleep But even on the scuffle\\nThe cleaner's press was in my jeans\\nAnd any eye for detail\\nCaught a little lace along the seams And you were in the parking lot\\nSubterranean by your own design\\nThe virtue of your style inscribed\\nOn your contempt for mine\\nJesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace\\nAnd Solomon kept his head in all his glory\\nIt's just that some steps outside the Boho dance\\nHave a fascination for me A camera pans the cocktail hour\\nBehind a blind of potted palms\\nAnd finds a lady in a Paris dress\\nWith runs in her nylons You read those books where luxury\\nComes as a guest to take a slave\\nBooks where artists in noble poverty\\nGo like virgins to the grave\\nDon't you get sensitive on me\\n'Cause I know you're just too proud\\nYou couldn't step outside the Boho dance now\\nEven if good fortune allowed Like a priest with a pornographic watch\\nLooking and longing on the sly\\nSure it's stricken from your uniform\\nBut you can't get it out of your eyes Nothing is capsulized in me\\nOn either side of town\\nThe streets were never really mine\\nNot mine these glamour gowns I stepped outside to breathe the air\\nAnd stare up at the stars\\nBig dipper hanging there\\nOver the rented car\\nOver the rented car\\nI'm a runaway from the record biz\\nFrom the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\nTiger, tiger burning bright Sophia says \\\"It's hard to catch\\nAnd harder still to ride\\nThe time to watch the beast the best\\nIs when it's purring at your side\\\"\\nPurring at your side\\nAccolades and honors\\nOne false move and you're a goner\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nIn the forest of the night The moon shed light\\nOn my hopeless plight\\nAs the radio blared so bland\\nEvery disc, a poker chip\\nEvery song just a one night stand\\nFormula music, girly guile\\nGenuine junk food for juveniles\\nUp and down the dial\\nMercenary style I watched the stars chuck down their spears\\nAnd a plane went blinking by\\nAnd I thought of Anna\\nWild and dear\\nLike fireworks in the sky\\nFireworks in the sky\\nI'm so sick of this game\\nIt's hip, it's hot\\nLife's too short, the whole thing's gotten\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nOh, be nice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring, boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\n(Fight to the light, fight to the light)\\nIn the forest of the night I've got a blue motel room\\nWith a blue bedspread\\nI've got the blues inside and outside my head\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I call you up when I'm down\\nHere in Savannah it's pouring rain\\nPalm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I call you up when I get back to town\\nI know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on\\nHanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm\\nWill you tell those girls that you've got German Measles\\nHoney, tell them you've got germs\\nI hope you'll be thinking of me\\nBecause I'll be thinking of you\\nWhile I'm traveling home alone\\nTell those girls that you've got Joni\\nShe's coming back home I've got road maps\\nFrom two dozen states\\nI've got coast to coast just to contemplate\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to town\\nIt's funny how these old feelings hang around\\nYou think they're gone\\nNo, no\\nThey just go underground\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to L.A. town\\nYou and me, we're like America and Russia\\nWe're always keeping score\\nWe're always balancing the power\\nAnd that can get to be a cold cold war\\nWe're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk\\nIn some neutral cafe\\nYou lay down your sneaking round the town, honey\\nAnd I'll lay down the highway I've got a blue motel room\\nWith a blue bedspread\\nI've got the blues inside and outside my head\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to town Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions\\nGilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor\\nTreasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where\\nNever mind their questions there's no answer for\\nThe roll of the harbor wake\\nThe songs that the rigging makes\\nThe taste of the spray he takes\\nAnd he learns to give\\nHe aches and he learns to live\\nHe stakes all his silver\\nOn a promise to be free\\nMermaids live in colonies\\nAll his sea dreams come to me City satins left at home I will not need them\\nI believe him when he tells of loving me\\nSomething truthful in the sea your lies will find you\\nLeave behind your streets he said and come to me\\nCome down from the neon nights\\nCome down from the tourist sights\\nRun down till the rain delights you\\nYou do not hide\\nSunlight will renew your pride\\nSkin white by skin golden\\nLike a promise to be free\\nDolphins playing in the sea\\nAll his sea dreams come to me Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings\\nI am smiling at your circles in the air\\nI will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping\\nFold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share\\nA dream that you love someone\\nA dream that the wars are done\\nA dream that you tell no one but the gray sea\\nThey'll say that you're crazy\\nAnd a dream of a baby\\nLike a promise to be free\\nChildren laughing out to sea\\nAll his sea dreams come to me Through the windless wells of wonder\\nBy the throbbing light machine\\nIn a tea leaf trance or under\\nOrders from the king and queen Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one People hurry by so quickly\\nDon't they hear the melodies\\nIn the chiming and the clicking\\nAnd the laughing harmonies Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one Some come dark and strange like dying\\nCrows and ravens whistling\\nLines of weeping, strings of crying\\nSo much said in listening Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one Does the moon play only silver\\nWhen it strums the galaxy\\nDying roses will they will their\\nPerfumed rhapsodies to me Songs to aging children come\\nThis is one She pulls the shade, it's just another\\nSunny Sunday\\nShe dodges the light like Blanche DuBois\\nBright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday\\nShe waits for the night to fall\\nThen she points a pistol through the door\\nAnd she aims at the streetlight\\nWhile the freeway hisses\\nDogs bark as the gun falls to the floor\\nThe streetlight's still burning\\nShe always misses\\nBut the day she hits\\nThat's the day she'll leave\\nThat one little victory, that's all she needs\\nShe pulls the shade it's just another\\nSunny Monday\\nShe waits for the night to fall Out on some borderline\\nSome mark of in between\\nI lay down golden-in time\\nAnd woke up vanishing Sweet bird you are\\nBriefer than a falling star\\nAll these vain promises on beauty jars\\nSomewhere with your wings on time\\nYou must be laughing\\nBehind our eyes\\nCalendars of our lives\\nCircled with compromise\\nSweet bird of time and change\\nYou must be laughing\\nUp on your feathers laughing Golden in time\\nCities under the sand\\nPower, ideals and beauty\\nFading in everyone's hand Give me some time\\nI feel like I'm losing mine\\nOut here on this horizon line\\nWith the earth spinning\\nAnd the sky forever rushing\\nNo one knows\\nThey can never get that close\\nGuesses at most\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching Fly silly seabird\\nNo dreams can possess you\\nNo voices can blame you\\nFor sun on your wings\\nMy gentle relations\\nHave names they must call me\\nFor loving the freedom\\nOf all flying things\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry I came to the city\\nAnd lived like old Crusoe\\nOn an island of noise\\nIn a cobblestone sea\\nAnd the beaches were concrete\\nAnd the stars paid a light bill\\nAnd the blossoms hung false\\nOn their store window trees\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry Out of the city\\nAnd down to the seaside\\nTo sun on my shoulders\\nAnd wind in my hair\\nBut sandcastles crumble\\nAnd hunger is human\\nAnd humans are hungry\\nFor worlds they can't share\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry I call to a seagull\\nWho dives to the waters\\nAnd catches his silver-fine\\nDinner alone\\nCrying where are the footprints\\nThat danced on these beaches\\nAnd the hands that cast wishes\\nThat sunk like a stone\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach Out of cry Every picture has its shadows\\nAnd it has some source of light\\nBlindness, blindness and sight\\nThe perils of benefactors\\nThe blessings of parasites\\nBlindness, blindness and sight\\nThreatened by all things\\nDevil of cruelty\\nDrawn to all things\\nDevil of delight\\nMythical devil of the ever-present laws\\nGoverning blindness, blindness and sight Suntans in reservation dining rooms\\nPale miners in their lantern rays\\nNight, night and day\\nHostage smile on presidents\\nFreedom scribbled in the subway\\nIt's like night, night and day\\nThreatened by all things\\nGod of cruelty\\nDrawn to all things\\nGod of delight\\nMythical god of the everlasting laws\\nGoverning day, day and night Critics of all expression\\nJudges in black and white\\nSaying it's wrong, saying it's right\\nCompelled by prescribed standards\\nOr some ideals we fight\\nFor wrong, wrong and right\\nThreatened by all things\\nMan of cruelty-mark of Cain\\nDrawn to all things\\nMan of delight-born again, born again\\nMan of the laws, the ever-broken laws\\nGoverning wrong, wrong and right\\nGoverning wrong, wrong and right\\nWrong and right Twinkle, twinkle what a pity\\nAll alone on such a pretty night\\nWith enchantment on your side Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy\\nSoft voice whispers, \\\"This can all be right\\nIf you'll come and share a ride\\\" Carnival in Kenora\\nI let him take me for a ride\\nOn a giant ferris wheel Up in the neon sky\\nOr far from the barker's cry\\nOne kiss can sometimes\\nMake you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel All the tents are taken down now\\nAll that's left is scuffled ground now\\nStill the magic echoes in the sand Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy\\nNow a stranger takes my hand\\nWe smile and the magic understands Carnival in Kenora\\nI let him take me for a ride\\nOn a giant Ferris wheel Up in the neon sky\\nOr far from the barker's cry\\nOne kiss can sometimes\\nMake you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel Out of the fire like Catholic saints\\nComes Scarlett and her deep complaint\\nMimicking tenderness she sees\\nIn sentimental movies\\nA celluloid rider comes to town\\nCinematic lovers sway\\nPlantations and sweeping ballroom gowns\\nTake her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines\\nChasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn\\nThrough stand-in boys and extra players\\nMagnolias hopeful in her auburn hair\\nShe comes from a school of southern charm\\nShe likes to have things her way\\nAny man in the world holding out his arm\\nWould soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud\\nNeighbors trying to sleep and yelling \\\"Not so loud!\\\"\\nLovers in anger Block of Ice\\nHarder and harder just to be nice\\nGiven in the night to dark dreams\\nFrom the dark things she feels\\nShe covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes\\nRunning from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised\\nCause it is not easy to be brave\\nTo walk around in so much need\\nTo carry the weight of all that greed\\nDressed in stolen clothes she stands\\nCast iron and frail\\nWith her impossibly gentle hands\\nAnd her blood-red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering\\nShe says \\\"A woman must have everything\\\"\\nShades of Scarlett Conquering\\nShe says \\\"A woman must have everything\\\" Tomorrow is Sunday\\nNow there's only one day left to go\\nTill you walk by\\nBelow my window\\nThe weekends drive me mad\\nHolidays are oh too sad\\n'Cause you don't go\\nBelow my window No one knows I'm here\\nOne day I just disappeared\\nAnd I took these two grey rooms up here\\nWith a view\\nWhen you walk by\\nBelow my window You look so youthful\\nTime has been untruthful\\nHeaven knows I loved you\\n30 years ago\\nHot days your shirt's undone\\nRainy days you run\\nOh and then you fade so fast\\nBelow my window No one knows I'm here\\nOne day I just disappeared\\nAnd I took these two grey rooms up here\\nWith a view\\nOnly when you walk by\\nBelow my window\\nWhen you walk by Below my window\\nBelow my window\\nHey hey\\nBelow my window\\nBelow my window\\nBelow my window Three waitresses all wearing\\nBlack diamond earrings\\nTalking about zombies\\nAnd Singapore slings\\nNo trouble in their faces\\nNot one anxious voice\\nNone of the crazy you get\\nFrom too much choice\\nThe thumb and the satchel\\nOr the rented Rolls-Royce\\nAnd you think she knows something\\nBy the second refill\\nYou think she's enlightened\\nAnd she totals your bill\\nYou say \\\"Show me the way\\nTo Barangrill\\\" Well some say it's in service\\nThey say \\\"Humble Makes Pure\\\"\\nYou're hoping it's near Folly\\n'Cause you're headed that way for sure\\nAnd you just have to laugh\\n'Cause it's all so crazy\\nAh, her mind's on her boyfriend\\nAnd eggs over easy\\nIt's just a trick on you\\nHer mirrors and your will\\nSo you ask the truck driver\\nOn the way to the till\\nBut he's just a slave\\nTo Barangrill The guy at the gas pumps\\nHe's got a lot of soul\\nHe sings Merry Christmas for you\\nJust like Nat King Cole\\nAnd he makes up his own tune\\nRight on the spot\\nAbout whitewalls and windshields\\nAnd this job he's got\\nAnd you want to get moving\\nAnd you want to stay still\\nBut lost in the moment\\nSome longing gets filled\\nAnd you even forget to ask\\n\\\"Hey, where's Barangrill?\\\" Rousseau walks on trumpet paths\\nSafaris to the heart of all that jazz\\nThrough I bars and girders-through wires and pipes\\nThe mathematic circuits of the modern nights\\nThrough huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews\\nThrough the class on Park and the trash on Vine\\nThrough Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue\\nThrough savage progress cuts the jungle line In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer\\nRousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear\\nThose cannibals-of shuck and jive\\nThey'll eat a working girl like her alive\\nWith his hard-edged eye and his steady hand\\nHe paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines\\nAnd he hangs a moon above a five-piece band\\nHe hangs it up above the jungle line The jungle line, the jungle line\\nScreaming in a ritual of sound and time\\nFloating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind\\nAnd drooling for a taste of something smuggled in\\nPretty women funneled through valves and smoke\\nCoy and bitchy, wild and fine\\nAnd charging elephants and chanting slaving boats\\nCharging, chanting down the jungle line There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb\\nThere's a poppy snake in a dressing room\\nPoppy poison-poppy tourniquet\\nIt slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit\\nAnd metal skin and ivory birds\\nGo steaming up to Rousseau's vines\\nThey go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge\\nSteaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line It was a rainy night\\nWe took a taxi to your mother's home\\nShe went to Florida and left you\\nWith your father's gun, alone\\nUpon her small white bed\\nI fell into a dream\\nYou sat up all the night and watched me\\nTo see, who in the world I might be I am from the Sunday school\\nI sing soprano in the upstairs choir\\nYou are a holy man\\nOn the F.M. radio\\nI sat up all the night and watched thee\\nTo see, who in the world you might be You called me beautiful\\nYou called your mother-she was very tanned\\nSo you packed your tent and you went\\nTo live out in the Arizona sand\\nYou are a refugee\\nFrom a wealthy family\\nYou gave up all the golden factories\\nTo see, who in the world you might be \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

gone gone?\\nCalled you on the phone, another dimension.\\nWell, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.\\nI went looking for you, are you gone, gone?\\n\\nDown by the ocean it was so dismal,\\nWomen all standing with a shock on their faces.\\nSad description, oh I was looking for you.\\n\\nEveryone was singing, girl is washed up\\nOn Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.\\nI was looking for you, are you gone gone?\\nPretty little girl, everyone cried.\\nShe was the victim of sweet suicide.\\nI went looking for you, are you gone gone?\\n\\nDown by the ocean it was so

went looking for you, are you gone gone?\\nPicked up my key, didn't reply.\\nWent to my room, started to cry.\\nYou were small, an angel, are you gone gone?\\n\\nDown by the ocean it was so

was just standing there alone\\nLooking at the shiny red tractor\\nHim and his daddy used to sit inside\\nAnd circle the blue fields and grease the night.\\nIt was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars\\n'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.\\nThen he put his head in the crux of his arm\\nAnd he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,\\nLet the ship slide open, and he went inside of it\\nAnd saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,\\nHe saw his daddy 'hind the control board,\\nAnd he was very different tonight\\n'Cause he was not human, he was not human.\\n\\nAnd then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy\\nThat the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,\\nWhite lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly\\nAnd he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,\\nNo black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven\\nAnd fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,\\n\\u201cNo, daddy, don't leave me here alone,\\nTake me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,\\nLet the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it\\nWhere you're not human, you are not human.\\u201d\\n\\nBut nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.\\nNobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm\\nAnd they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered\\nAnd they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet\\nSlit in his nose and all the others went shooting\\nAnd he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake\\nGrabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,\\nAll his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,\\n\\u201cI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,\\nI won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,\\nTake me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship\\nAnd the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.\\u201d\\n\\nI am helium raven and this movie is mine,\\nSo he cried out as he stretched the sky,\\nPushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?\\nWe'll just be dreaming of animation night and day\\nAnd won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,\\nOh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,\\nIt's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights\\nMoving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,\\nAnd he put up his hands and he said, \\u201cIt's me, it's me,\\nI'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,\\nI'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,\\nDon't let me here,\\u201d the son, the sign, the cross,\\nLike the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,\\nThe mother standing in the doorway letting her sons\\nNo longer presidents but prophets\\nThey're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,\\nHe's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation\\nIt's all gonna split his skull\\nIt's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining\\nLike a fist that's gonna shoot them up\\nLike light, like Mohammed Boxer\\nTake them up up up up up up\\nOh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,\\nI'm going up, I'm going up\\nTake me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there\\nGo up go up go up go up up up up up up up\\nUp, up to the belly of a ship.\\nLet the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it\\nWhere we are not human, we're not human.\\n\\nWell, there was sand, there were tiles,\\nThe sun had melted the sand and it coagulated\\nLike a river of glass\\nWhen it hardened he looked at the surface\\nHe saw his face\\nAnd where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,\\nWhere there were eyes there were just two white opals\\nAnd he looked up and the rays shot\\nAnd he saw raven comin' in\\nAnd he crawled on his back and he went up\\nUp up up up up up\\nSha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,\\nSha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,\\nSha da do wop, da shaman do way,\\nWe like birdland.\\n\\n\\nEvery night before I go to sleep\\nFind a ticket, win a lottery,\\nScoop the pearls up from the sea\\nCash them in and buy you all

in my arms in her swaddling clothes\\nAnd I know soon that the sky will split\\nAnd the planets will shift,\\nBalls of jade will drop and existence will stop.\\nLittle sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.\\nLittle sister, the fates are calling on you.\\n\\nAh, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,\\nThe sea rushes up my knees like flame\\nAnd I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc\\nAnd the cause is you lookin' up at me.\\nOh baby, I remember when you were born,\\nIt was dawn and the storm settled in my belly\\nAnd I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas\\nAnd I lit a match and the void went flash\\nAnd the sky split and the planets hit,\\nBalls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.\\nLittle sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.\\nLittle sister, the fates are calling on you.\\n\\nI was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,\\nSo with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.\\nAh, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,\\nSo I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces\\nBurst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,\\nAnd I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.\\nYour soul was like a network of spittle,\\nLike glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,\\nAnd I prayed as the lightning attacked\\nThat something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,\\nSomething will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.\\n\\nThe palm trees fall into the sea,\\nIt doesn't matter much to me\\nAs long as you're safe, Kimberly.\\nAnd I can gaze deep\\nInto your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\\nLooking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\\nInto your starry eyes, oh.\\n\\nOh, in your starry eyes, baby,\\nLooking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.\\n\\nOh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\\nInto your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby\\n\\n\\nCar stopped in a clearing,\\nRibbon of life, it was nearing.\\nI saw the boy break out of his skin.\\nMy heart turned over and I crawled in.\\nHe cried, \\\"Break it up, oh I don't understand,\\nBreak it up, I can't comprehend.\\nBreak it up, oh, I want to feel you.\\nBreak it up, don't talk to me that way,\\nI'm not listening.\\\"\\n\\nSnow started falling,\\nI could hear the angel calling.\\nWe rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.\\nThe boy flew away and he started to sing.\\nHe sang, \\\"Break it up, oh, I don't understand.\\nBreak it up, I can't comprehend.\\nBreak it up, oh, I want to feel you.\\nBreak it up, don't look at me.\\\"\\n\\nThe sky was raging, the boy disappeared,\\nI fell on my knee\\nAtmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.\\nI cried, \\\"Take me please!\\\"\\n\\nIce, it was shining.\\nI could feel my heart, it was melting.\\nI tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.\\nI ripped my skin open and then I broke through.\\nI cried, \\\"Break it up, oh, now I understand.\\nBreak it up, and I want to go.\\nBreak it up, oh please take me with you.\\nBreak it up, I can feel it

possibilities.\\n(up there)\\nI seize the first possibility, is the sea around me\\nI was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor\\n(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee\\n(on the screen)\\nAnd I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame\\n(in the heart of man)\\nThe waves were coming in like Arabian stallions\\nGradually lapping into sea horses\\nHe picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat\\n(the spoon)\\nAnd let it deep in\\n(the veins)\\nDip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities\\nIt started hardening\\nDip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities\\nIt started hardening in my hand\\nAnd I felt the arrows of desire\\n\\nI put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour\\nBut no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area\\n(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)\\nAnd go Johnny go and do the watusi,\\nYeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...\\nShined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling\\nOur lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining\\nYour nerves, your mane of the black shining horse\\nAnd my fingers all entwined through the air,\\nI could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,\\n(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)\\nThe hairs were like wires going through my body\\nI I that's how I\\nthat's how I\\nI died\\n(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)\\n(they knew what they were after)\\n[Everything on the current] moved up\\nI tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,\\nLike playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility\\nWas a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities\\nThere's no land but the land\\n\\nlooked at my hands, and there's a red stream\\nthat went streaming through the sands like fingers,\\nlike arteries, like fingers\\n(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)\\nHe lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)\\nHe opened his throat (your eyes)\\nHis vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands\\nThe scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody

everything's warmer there\\nSo you write him a letter, say, \\\"her eyes are blue\\\"\\nHe sends you a poem and she's lost to you\\nLittle, green, he's a non-comformer Just a little green\\nLike the color when the spring is born\\nThere'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow\\nJust a little green\\nLike the night's when the Northern lights perform\\nThere'll be icicles and birthday clothes and sometimes\\nThere'll be sorrow Child with a child pretending\\nWeary of lies you're sending home\\nSo you sign all the papers in the family name\\nYou're sad and you're sorry but you're not

to leave here Carey\\nBut it's really not my home\\nMy fingernails are filthy\\nI've got beach tar on my feet\\nAnd I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne Oh Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)\\nAnd I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nOh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe\\nAnd I will buy you a bottle of

put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nYou're a mean old Daddy, but I like you The wind is in from Africa\\nLast night I couldn't sleep\\nOh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, but it's\\nReally not my home\\nMaybe it's been too long a time since I was\\nScramblin' down in the street\\nNow they got me used to that clean white linen and that\\nFancy French cologne Oh Carey, get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)\\nI'll put on my finest silver (I'll put on some silver)\\nWe'll go to the Mermaid Cafe, have fun tonight\\nI said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight I came upon a child of God\\nHe was walking along the road\\nAnd I asked him, where are you going\\nAnd this he told me\\nI'm going on down to Yasgur's farm\\nI'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band\\nI'm going to camp out on the land\\nI'm going to try an' get my soul free\\nWe are stardust\\nWe are golden\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden Then can I walk beside you\\nI have come here to lose the smog\\nAnd I feel to be a cog in something turning\\nWell maybe it is just the time of year\\nOr maybe it's the time of man\\nI don't know who l am\\nBut you know life is for learning\\nWe are stardust\\nWe are golden\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden By the time we got to Woodstock\\nWe were half a million strong\\nAnd everywhere there was song and celebration\\nAnd I dreamed I saw the bombers\\nRiding shotgun in the sky\\nAnd they were turning into butterflies\\nAbove our nation\\nWe are stardust\\nBillion year old carbon\\nWe are golden\\nCaught in the devil's bargain\\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\\nBack to the garden I'm traveling in some vehicle\\nI'm sitting in some cafe\\nA defector from the petty wars\\nThat shell shocked love away There's comfort in melancholy\\nWhen there's no need to explain\\nIt's just as natural as the weather\\nIn this moody sky today In our possessive coupling\\nSo much could not be expressed\\nSo now I'm returning to myself\\nThese things that you and I suppressed I see something of myself in everyone\\nJust at this moment of the world\\nAs snow gathers like bolts of lace\\nWaltzing on a ballroom girl You know it never has been easy\\nWhether you do or you do not resign\\nWhether you travel the breadth of extremities\\nOr stick to some straighter line Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock\\nThey're either going to thaw out or freeze\\nListen...strains of Benny Goodman\\nComing through' the snow and the pinewood trees I'm porous with travel fever\\nBut you know I'm so glad to be on my own\\nStill somehow the slightest touch of a stranger\\nCan set up trembling in my bones I know, no one's going to show me everything\\nWe all come and go unknown\\nEach so deep and superficial\\nBetween the forceps and the stone Well I looked at the granite markers\\nThose tribute to finality, to eternity\\nAnd then I looked at myself here\\nChicken scratching for my immortality In the church they light the candles\\nAnd the wax rolls down like tears\\nThere's the hope and the hopelessness\\nI've witnessed thirty years We're only particles of change I know, I know\\nOrbiting around the sun\\nBut how can I have that point of view\\nWhen I'm always bound and tied to someone White flags of winter chimneys\\nWaving truce against the moon\\nIn the mirrors of a modern bank\\nFrom the window of a hotel room I'm traveling in some vehicle\\nI'm sitting in some cafe\\nA defector from the petty wars\\nUntil love sucks me back that way My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nThe way he described it\\nHe said I'd be better dead than live\\nI didn't listen to his jive\\nI knew all along\\nThat he was all wrong\\nAnd I knew that he thought\\nI was crazy but I'm not, oh no My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nHe said I'd need treatment\\nBut I'm not that easily led\\nHe said I was the type\\nThat was most inclined\\nWhen out of his sight\\nTo be out of my mind\\nAnd he thought I was nuts\\nNo more ifs or ands or buts They say as a child\\nI appeared a little bit wild\\nWith all my crazy ideas\\nBut I knew what was happening\\nI knew I was a genius\\nWhat's so strange when you know\\nThat you're a wizard at three?\\nI knew that this was meant to be Now I heard little children\\nWere supposed to sleep tight\\nThat's why I got into the vodka one night\\nMy parents got frantic\\nDidn't know what to do\\nBut I saw some crazy scenes\\nBefore I came to\\nNow do you think I was crazy?\\nI may have been only three\\nBut I was swinging They all laugh at angry young men\\nThey all laugh at Edison\\nAnd also at Einstein\\nSo why should I feel sorry\\nIf they just couldn't understand\\nThe idiomatic logic\\nThat went on in my head\\nI had a brain\\nIt was insane\\nOh, they used to laugh at me\\nWhen I refused to ride\\nOn all those double decker buses\\nAll because there was no driver on the top My analyst told me\\nThat I was right out of my head\\nBut I said dear doctor\\nI think that it's you instead\\nBecause I have got a thing\\nThat's unique and new\\nTo prove it I'll have\\nThe last laugh on you\\n'Cause instead of one head\\nI got two\\nAnd you know two heads are better than one Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard\\nWas a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words\\nIt came a-reeling up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums Oh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nAnd we'll wear it 'till the night comes Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw\\nWas the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall\\nBlue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon Oh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nThere's a sun show every second Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today\\nAnd the streets are paved with passersby\\nAnd pigeons fly\\nAnd papers lie\\nWaiting to blow away Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew\\nThere was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too\\nAnd the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses\\nOh, won't you stay\\nWe'll put on the day\\nAnd we'll talk in present tenses When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away\\nI will bring you incense owls by night\\nBy candlelight\\nBy jewel-light\\nIf only you will stay\\nPretty baby, won't you\\nWake up, it's a Chelsea morning I was driving across the burning desert\\nWhen I spotted six jet planes\\nLeaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain\\nIt was the hexagram of the heavens\\nit was the strings of my guitar\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines\\nIs a song so wild and blue\\nIt scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you\\nThen your life becomes a travelogue\\nOf picture-post-card-charms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm People will tell you where they've gone\\nThey'll tell you where to go\\nBut till you get there yourself you never really know\\nWhere some have found their paradise\\nOthers just come to harm\\nOh Amelia, it was just a false alarm I wish that he was here tonight\\nIt's so hard to obey\\nHis sad request of me to kindly stay away\\nSo this is how I hide the hurt\\nAs the road leads cursed and charmed\\nI tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation\\nShe was swallowed by the sky\\nOr by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly\\nLike Icarus ascending\\nOn beautiful foolish arms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm Maybe I've never really loved\\nI guess that is the truth\\nI've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude\\nAnd looking down on everything\\nI crashed into his arms\\nAmelia, it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel\\nTo shower off the dust\\nAnd I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust\\nI dreamed of 747's\\nOver geometric farms\\nDreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms I went to Staten Island.\\nTo buy myself a mandolin\\nAnd I saw the long white dress of love\\nOn a storefront mannequin\\nBig boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,\\nAll for something lacy\\nSome girl's going to see that dress\\nAnd crave that day like crazy Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada\\nThey can balance and they can climb\\nLike their fathers before them\\nThey'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline\\nShine your light on me Miss Liberty\\nBecause as soon as this ferry boat docks\\nI'm headed to the church\\nTo play Bingo\\nFleece me with the gamblers' flocks I can keep my cool at poker\\nBut I'm a fool when love's at stake\\nBecause I can't conceal emotion\\nWhat I'm feeling's always written on my face\\nThere's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street\\nI went in to see her as a kind of joke\\nAnd she lit a candle for my love luck\\nAnd eighteen bucks went up in smoke Sharon, I left my man\\nAt a North Dakota junction\\nAnd I came out to the \\\"Big Apple\\\" here\\nTo face the dream's malfunction\\nLove's a repetitious danger\\nYou'd think I'd be accustomed to\\nWell, I do accept the changes\\nAt least better than I used to do A woman I knew just drowned herself\\nThe well was deep and muddy\\nShe was just shaking off futility\\nOr punishing somebody\\nMy friends were calling up all day yesterday\\nAll emotions and abstractions\\nIt seems we all live so close to that line\\nAnd so far from satisfaction Dora says, \\\"Have children!\\\"\\nMama and Betsy say-\\\"Find yourself a charity.\\\"\\nHelp the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology.\\\"\\nWell, there's a wide wide world of noble causes\\nAnd lovely landscapes to discover\\nBut all I really want right now\\nIs, find another lover When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon\\nI went to every wedding in that little town\\nTo see the tears and the kisses\\nAnd the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown\\nAnd walking home on the railroad tracks\\nOr swinging on the playground swing\\nLove stimulated my illusions\\nMore than anything And when I went skating after Golden Reggie\\nYou know it was white lace I was chasing\\nChasing dreams\\nMama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans\\nHe showed me first you get the kisses\\nAnd then you get the tears\\nBut the ceremony of the bells and lace\\nStill veils this reckless fool here Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink\\nCircling in singles and in pairs\\nIn this vigorous anonymity\\nA blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares\\nAnd the power of reason\\nAnd the flowers of deep feeling\\nSeem to serve me\\nOnly to deceive me Sharon you've got a husband\\nAnd a family and a farm\\nI've got the apple of temptation\\nAnd a diamond snake around my arm\\nBut you still have your music\\nAnd I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky\\nYou sing for your friends and your family\\nI'll walk green pastures by and by Again and again the same situation\\nFor so many years\\nTethered to a ringing telephone\\nIn a room full to mirrors\\nA pretty girl in your bathroom\\nChecking out her sex appeal\\nI asked myself when you said you loved me\\n\\\"Do you think this can be real?\\\" Still, I sent up my prayer\\nWondering where it had to go\\nWith heaven full of astronauts\\nAnd the Lord on death row\\nWhile the millions of his lost and lonely ones\\nCall out and glamour to be found\\nCaught in their struggle for higher positions\\nAnd their search for love that sticks around You've had lots of lovely women\\nNow you turn your gaze to me\\nWeighing the beauty and the imperfection\\nTo see if I'm worthy\\nLike the church\\nLike a cop\\nLike a mother\\nYou want me to be truthful\\nSometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though\\nAnd I need your approval Still, I sent up my prayer\\nWondering who was there to hear\\nI said \\\"Send me somebody\\nWho's strong, and somewhat sincere\\\"\\nWith the millions of the lost and lonely ones\\nI called out to be released\\nCaught in my struggle for higher achievements\\nAnd my search for love\\nThat don't seem to cease Look out the left the captain said\\nThe lights down there, that's where we'll land\\nI saw a falling star burn up\\nAbove the Las Vegas sands\\nIt wasn't the one that you gave to me\\nThat night down south between the trailers\\nNot the early one\\nThat you can wish upon,\\nNot the northern one\\nThat guides in the sailors Oh star bright, star bright\\nYou've got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't have got on this flight tonight You got the touch so gentle and sweet\\nBut you've got that look so critical\\nNow I can't talk to you baby\\nI get so weak\\nSometimes I think love is just mythical\\nUp there's a heaven\\nDown there's a town\\nBlackness everywhere and little lights shine\\nOh, blackness, blackness dragging me down\\nCome on light the candle in this poor heart of mine Oh star bright, star bright\\nYou've got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight I'm drinking sweet champagne\\nGot the headphones up high\\nCan't numb you out\\nCan't drum you out of my mind\\nThey're playing, Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,\\nOoh, ooh, love is blind Up go the flaps, down go the wheels\\nI hope you got your heat turned on baby\\nI hope they finally fixed your automobile\\nI hope it's better when we meet again baby Star bright, star bright\\nYou got the lovin' that I like, all right\\nTurn this crazy bird around\\nI shouldn't have got on this flight tonight There's a man who's been out sailing\\nIn a decade full of dreams\\nAnd he takes her to a schooner\\nAnd he treats her like a queen\\nBearing beads from California\\nWith their amber stones and green\\nHe has called her from the harbor\\nHe has kissed her with his freedom\\nHe has heard her off to starboard\\nIn the breaking and the breathing\\nOf the water weeds\\nWhile she was busy being free There's a man who's climbed a mountain\\nAnd he's calling out her name\\nAnd he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles\\nHe calls again\\nHe can think her there beside him\\nHe can miss her just the same\\nHe has missed her in the forest\\nWhile he showed her all the flowers\\nAnd the branches sang the chorus\\nAs he climbed the scaley towers\\nOf a forest tree\\nWhile she was somewhere being free There's a man who's sent a letter\\nAnd he's waiting for reply\\nHe has asked her of her travels\\nSince the day they said goodbye\\nHe writes \\\"Wish you were beside me\\nWe can make it if we try\\\"\\nHe has seen her at the office\\nWith her name on all his papers\\nThrough the sharing of the profits\\nHe will find it hard to shake her\\nFrom his memory\\nAnd she's so busy being free There's a lady in the city\\nAnd she thinks she loves them all\\nThere's the one who's thinking of her\\nThere's the one who sometimes calls\\nThere's the one who writes her letters\\nWith his facts and figures scrawl\\nShe has brought them to her senses\\nThey have laughed inside her laughter\\nNow she rallies her defenses\\nFor she fears that one will ask her\\nFor eternity\\nAnd she's so busy being free There's a man who sends her medals\\nHe is bleeding from the war\\nThere's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store\\nThere's a drummer and a dreamer\\nAnd you know there may be more\\nShe will love them when she sees them\\nThey will lose her if they follow\\nAnd she only means to please them\\nAnd her heart is full and hollow\\nLike a cactus tree\\nWhile she's so busy being free I pulled up behind a Cadillac\\nWe were waiting for the light\\nAnd I took a look at his license plate\\nIt said, \\\"Just Ice\\\"\\nIs justice just ice?\\nGoverned by greed and lust?\\nJust the strong doing what they can\\nAnd the weak suffering what they must?\\nOh, and the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nSex kills Doctors' pills give you brand new ills\\nAnd the bills bury you like an avalanche\\nAnd lawyers haven't been this popular\\nSince Robespierre slaughtered half of France!\\nAnd Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know\\nThe balance is undone, crazy ions\\nYou can feel it out in traffic\\nEveryone hates everyone\\nAnd the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nSex kills All these jack-offs at the office\\nThe rapist in the pool\\nOh, and the tragedies in the nurseries\\nLittle kids packin' guns to school\\nThe ulcerated ozone\\nThese tumors of the skin\\nThis hostile sun beating down on\\nMassive mess we're in\\nAnd the gas leaks\\nAnd the oil spills\\nAnd sex sells everything\\nAnd sex kills\\nSex kills\\nSex kills\\nOh, sex kills\\nSex kills He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel\\nHe was drinking for diversion\\nHe was thinking for himself\\nA little money riding on the Maple Leafs\\nAlong comes a lady in lacy sleeves\\nShe says let me sit down\\nYou know, drinkin' alone's a shame (It's a shame it's a crying shame)\\nLook at those jokers\\nGlued to that damn hockey game\\nHey honey-you've got lots of cash\\nBring us round a bottle\\nAnd we'll have some laughs\\nGin's what I'm drinking\\nI was raised on robbery I'm a pretty good cook\\nSitting on my groceries\\nCome up to my kitchen\\nI'll show you my best recipe\\nI try and I try but I can't save a cent\\nI'm up after midnight, cooking\\nTrying to make my rent\\nI'm rough but I'm pleasin'\\nI was raised on robbery We had a little money once\\nThey were pushing through a four lane highway\\nGovernment gave us three thousand dollars\\nYou should have seen it fly away\\nFirst he bought a '57 Biscayne\\nHe put it in the ditch\\nHe drunk up all the rest\\nThat son of a bitch\\nHis blood's bad whiskey\\nI was raised on robbery You know you ain't bad looking\\nI like the way you hold your drinks\\nCome home with me, honey\\nI ain't asking for no full length mink\\nHey, where you going\\nDon't go yet\\nYour glass ain't empty and we just met\\nYou're mean when your loaded\\nI was raised on robbery My old man he's a singer in the park\\nHe's a walker in the rain\\nHe's a dancer in the dark\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied and true no, my old man\\nKeeping away my blues He's my sunshine in the morning\\nHe's my fireworks at the end of the day\\nHe's the warmest chord I ever heard\\nPlay that warm chord, play and stay baby\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied and true, my old man\\nKeeping away my blues But when he's gone\\nMe and them lonesome blues collide\\nThe bed's too big\\nThe frying pan's too wide Then he comes home\\nAnd he takes me in his loving arms\\nAnd he tells me all his troubles\\nAnd he tells me all my charms\\nWe don't need no piece of paper from the city hall\\nKeeping us tied

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,\\nAnd he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday\\nCynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe\\nYou laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes\\nThey're full of moon\\nYou like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you\\nAll those pretty lies, pretty lies\\nWhen you gonna realize they're only pretty lies\\nOnly pretty lies, just pretty lies He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed\\nThree buttons and the thing began to whirr\\nAnd a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie\\nAnd she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close\\nRichard, you haven't really changed, I said\\nIt's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head\\nYou got tombs in your eyes, but the songs\\nYou punched are dreaming\\nListen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet\\nWhen you gonna get yourself back on your feet?\\nOh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet Richard got married to a figure skater\\nAnd he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator\\nAnd he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on\\nAnd all the house lights left up bright\\nI'm gonna blow this damn candle out\\nI don't want Nobody comin' over to my table\\nI got nothing to talk to anybody about\\nAll good dreamers pass this way some day\\nHidin' behind bottles in dark cafes\\nDark cafes\\nOnly a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings\\nAnd fly away\\nOnly a phase, these dark cafe days When Charlie speaks of Lester\\nYou know someone great has gone\\nThe sweetest swinging music man\\nHad a Porkie Pig hat on\\nA bright star\\nIn a dark age\\nWhen the bandstands had a thousand ways\\nOf refusing a black man admission\\nBlack musician\\nIn those days they put him in an\\nUnderdog position\\nCellars and chittlins' When Lester took him a wife\\nArm and arm went black and white\\nAnd some saw red\\nAnd drove them from their hotel bed\\nLove is never easy\\nIt's short of the hope we have for happiness\\nBright and sweet\\nLove is never easy street!\\nNow we are black and white\\nEmbracing out in the lunatic New York night\\nIt's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town\\nOr be hung in a tree\\nThat's unlikely! Tonight these crowds\\nAre happy and loud\\nChildren are up dancing in the streets\\nIn the sticky middle of the night\\nSummer serenade\\nOf taxi horns and fun arcades\\nWhere right or wrong\\nUnder neon\\nEvery feeling goes on!\\nFor you and me\\nThe sidewalk is a history book\\nAnd a circus\\nDangerous clowns\\nBalancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions\\nThey have been handed\\nDay by day\\nGenerations on down We came up from the subway\\nOn the music midnight makes\\nTo Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone\\nIn taxi horns and brakes\\nNow Charlie's down in Mexico\\nWith the healers\\nSo the sidewalk leads us with music\\nTo two little dancers\\nDancing outside a black bar\\nThere's a sign up on the awning\\nIt says \\\"Pork Pie Hat Bar\\\"\\nAnd there's black babies dancing\\nTonight! Don't interrupt the sorrow\\nDarn right\\nIn flames our prophet witches\\nBe polite\\nA room full of glasses\\nHe says \\\"Your notches liberation doll\\\"\\nAnd he chains me with that serpent\\nTo that Ethiopian wall Anima rising\\nQueen of Queens\\nWash my guilt of Eden\\nWash and balance me\\nAnima rising\\nUprising in me tonight\\nShe's a vengeful little goddess\\nWith an ancient crown to fight Truth goes up in vapors\\nThe steeples lean\\nWinds of change patriarchs\\nSnug in your bible belt dreams\\nGod goes up the chimney\\nLike childhood Santa Claus\\nThe good slaves love the good book\\nA rebel loves a cause I'm leaving on the 1:15\\nYou're darn right\\nSince I was seventeen\\nI've had no one over me\\nHe says \\\"Anima rising-\\nSo what-\\nPetrified wood process\\nTall timber down to rock!\\\" Don't interrupt the sorrow\\nDarn right\\nHe says \\\"We walked on the moon\\nYou be polite.\\\"\\nDon't let up the sorrow\\nDeath and birth and death and birth\\nHe says \\\"Bring that bottle kindly\\nAnd I'll pad your purse-\\nI've got a head full of quandary\\nAnd a mighty, mighty, thirst.\\\" Seventeen glasses\\nRhine wine\\nMilk of the Madonna\\nClandestine\\nHe don't let up the sorrow\\nHe lies and he cheats\\nIt takes a heart like Mary's these days\\nWhen your man gets weak Varnished weeds in window jars\\nTarnished beads on tapestries\\nKept in satin boxes are\\nReflections of love's memories Letters from across the seas\\nRoses dipped in sealing wax\\nValentines and maple leaves\\nTucked into a paperback Guess I'll throw them all away\\nI found someone to love today Dark with darker moods is he\\nNot a golden Prince who's come\\nThrough columbines and wizardry\\nTo talk of castles in the sun Still I'll take a chance and see\\nI found someone to love today There's a sorrow in his eyes\\nLike the angel made of tin\\nWhat will happen if I try\\nTo place another heart in him In a Bleeker Street cafe\\nI found someone to love today\\nI found someone to love today I am a woman of heart and mind\\nWith time on her hands\\nNo child to raise\\nYou come to me like a little boy\\nAnd I give you my scorn and my praise\\nYou think I'm like your mother\\nOr another lover or your sister\\nOr the queen of your dreams\\nOr just another silly girl\\nWhen love makes a fool of me After the rush when you come back down\\nYou're always disappointed\\nNothing seems to keep you high\\nDrive your bargains\\nPush your papers\\nWin your medals\\nFuck your strangers\\nDon't it leave you on the empty side\\nI'm looking for affection and respect\\nA little passion\\nAnd you want stimulation-nothing more\\nThat's what I think\\nBut you know I'll try to be there for you\\nWhen your spirits start to sink All this talk about holiness now\\nIt must be the start of the latest style\\nIs it all books and words\\nOr do you really feel it?\\nDo you really laugh?\\nDo you really care?\\nDo you really smile\\nWhen you smile?\\nYou criticize and you flatter\\nYou imitate the best\\nAnd the rest you memorize\\nYou know the times you impress me most\\nAre the times when you don't try\\nWhen you don't even try A strange boy is weaving\\nA course of grace and havoc\\nOn a yellow skateboard\\nThrough midday sidewalk traffic\\nJust when I think he's foolish and childish\\nAnd I want him to be manly\\nI catch my fool and my child\\nNeeding love and understanding What a strange, strange boy\\nHe still lives with his family\\nEven the war and the navy\\nCouldn't bring him to maturity He keeps referring back to school days\\nAnd clinging to his child\\nFidgeting and bullied\\nHis crazy wisdom holding onto something wild\\nHe asked me to be patient\\nWell I failed\\n\\\"Grow up!\\\" I cried\\nAnd as, the smoke was clearing he said\\n\\\"Give me one good reason why!\\\" What a strange, strange boy\\nHe sees the cars as sets of waves\\nSequences of mass and space\\nHe sees the damage in my face We got high on travel\\nAnd we got drunk on alcohol\\nAnd on love the strongest poison and medicine of all\\nSee how that feeling comes and goes\\nLike the pull of moon on tides\\nNow I am surf rising\\nNow parched ribs of sand at his side What a strange, strange boy\\nI gave him clothes and jewelry\\nI gave him my warm body\\nI gave him power over me A thousand glass eyes were staring\\nIn a cellar full of antique dolls\\nI found an old piano\\nAnd sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls\\nWhile the boarders were snoring\\nUnder crisp white sheets of curfew\\nWe were newly lovers then\\nWe were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter\\nI came out two days on your tail\\nThose two bald-headed days in November\\nBefore the first snowflakes sail\\nOut on the vast and subtle plains of mystery\\nA split tongue spirit talks\\nNoble as a nickel chief\\nStriking up an old juke box\\nAnd he says:\\n\\\"Snakes along the railroad tracks.\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Eagles in jet trails\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Coils around feathers and talons on scales\\nGravel under the belly plates\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Wind in the Wings\\\"\\nHe says, \\\"Big bird dragging its tail in the dust\\nSnake kite flying on a string.\\\" I come from open prairie\\nGiven some wisdom and a lot of jive!\\nLast night the ghosts of my old ideas\\nReran on channel five\\nAnd it howled so spooky for its eagle soul\\nI nearly broke down and cried\\nBut the split tongue spirit laughed at me\\nHe says, \\\"Your serpent cannot be denied.\\\"\\nOur serpents love the whisky bars\\nThey love the romance of the crime\\nBut didn't I see a neon sign\\nFester on your hotel blind\\nAnd a country road come off the wall\\nAnd swoop down at the crowd at the bar\\nAnd put me at the top of your danger list\\nJust for being so much like you are! You're a coward against the altitude\\nYou're a coward against the flesh\\nCoward, caught between yes and no\\nReckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!\\nReckless brazen in the play\\nOf your changing traffic lights\\nCoward, slinking down the hall\\nto another restless night\\nAs we center behind the eight ball\\nAs we rock between the sheets\\nAs we siphon the colored language\\nOff the farms and the streets\\nHere in Good-Old-God-Save-America\\nthe home of the brave and the free\\nWe are all hopelessly oppressed cowards\\nOf some duality\\nOf restless multiplicity\\n(Oh say can you see) Restless for streets and honky tonks\\nRestless for home and routine\\nRestless for country-safety-and her\\nRestless for the likes of reckless me\\nRestless sweeps like fire and rain\\nOver virgin wilderness\\nIt prowls like hookers and thieves\\nThrough bolt locked tenements\\nBehind my bolt locked door\\nThe eagle and the serpent are at war in me\\nThe serpent fighting for blind desire\\nThe eagle for clarity\\nWhat strange prizes these battles bring\\nThese hectic joys-these weary blues\\nPuffed up and strutting when I think I win\\nDown and shaken when I think I lose\\nThere are rivets up here in this eagle\\nThere are box cars down there on your snake\\nAnd we are twins of spirit\\nNo matter which route home we take\\nOr what we forsake\\nWe're going to come up to the eyes of clarity\\nAnd we'll go down to the beads of guile\\nThere is danger and education\\nIn living out such a reckless life style\\nI touched you on the central plains\\nIt was plane to train my twin\\nIt was just plane shadow to train shadow\\nBut to me it was skin to skin\\nThe spirit talks in spectrums\\nHe talks to mother earth to father sky\\nSelf indulgence to self denial\\nMan

kind person\\nYou're a cold person too\\nIt's down to you You go down to the pick up station\\nCraving warmth and beauty\\nYou settle for less than fascination\\nA few drinks later you're not so choosy\\nWhen the closing lights strip off the shadows\\nOn this strange new flesh you've found\\nClutching the night to you like a fig leaf\\nYou hurry\\nTo the blackness\\nAnd the blankets\\nTo lay down an impression\\nAnd your loneliness In the morning there are lovers in the street\\nThey look so high\\nYou brush against a stranger\\nAnd you both apologize\\nOld friends seem indifferent\\nYou must have brought that on\\nOld bonds have broken down\\nLove is gone\\nOoh, love is gone\\nWritten on your spirit this sad song\\nLove is gone Everything comes and goes\\nPleasure moves on too early\\nAnd trouble leaves too slow\\nJust when you're thinking\\nYou've finally got it made\\nBad news comes knocking\\nAt your garden gate\\nKnocking for you\\nConstant stranger\\nYou're a brute, you're an angel\\nYou can crawl, you can fly too\\nIt's down to you\\nIt all comes down to you I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town\\nIt hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down\\nWhen the sun turns traitor cold\\nand all trees are shivering in a naked row\\nI get the urge for going but I never seem to go\\nI get the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in\\nI had me a man in summertime\\nHe had summer-colored skin\\nAnd not another girl in town\\nMy darling's heart could win\\nBut when the leaves fell on the ground\\nAnd bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow\\nHe got the urge for going and I had to let him go\\nHe got the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass was turning brown And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in\\nNow the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout\\nAnd all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out\\nSee the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow\\nThey've got the urge for going and they've got the wings so they can go\\nThey get the urge for going\\nWhen the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in\\nI'll ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin\\nI'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll bolt my wandering in\\nI'd like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so\\nBut she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go\\nShe get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown\\nAnd all her empires are falling down\\nAnd winter's closing in\\nAnd I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown\\nAnd summertime is falling down The story hit the news\\nFrom coast to coast\\nThey said you beat the girl\\nYou loved the most\\nYour charitable acts\\nSeemed out of place\\nWith the beauty\\nWith your fist marks on her face\\nYour buddies all stood by\\nThey bet their\\nFortunes and their fame\\nThat she was out of line\\nAnd you were not to blame Six hundred thousand doctors\\nAre putting on rubber gloves\\nAnd they're poking\\nAt the miseries made of love\\nThey say they're learning\\nHow to spot\\nThe battered wives\\nAmong all the women\\nThey see bleeding through their lives\\nI bleed\\nFor your perversity\\nThese red words that make a stain\\nOn your white-washed claim that\\nShe was out of line\\nAnd you were not to blame I heard your baby say\\nWhen he was only three\\n\\\"Daddy, let's get some girls\\nOne for you and one for me\\\"\\nHis mother had the frailty\\nYou despise\\nAnd the looks you love\\nTo drive to suicide\\nNot one wet eye around her\\nLonely little grave\\nSaid \\\"He was out of line, girl\\nYou were not to blame\\\" When morning comes to Morgantown\\nThe merchants roll their awnings down\\nThe milktrucks make their morning rounds\\nIn morning, Morgantown We'll

denied\\n\\\"Heart and humor and humility\\\"\\nHe said \\\"Will lighten up your heavy load\\\"\\nI left him for the refuge of the roads I fell in with some drifters\\nCast upon a beach town\\nWinn

the Gulf of Mexico\\nThey were overflowing in the refuge of the roads There was spring along the ditches\\nThere were good times in the cities\\nOh, radiant happiness\\nIt was all so light and easy\\nTill I started analyzing\\nAnd I brought on my old ways\\nA thunderhead of judgment was\\nGathering in my gaze\\nAnd it made most people nervous\\nThey just didn't want to know\\nWhat I was seeing in the refuge of the roads I pulled off into a forest\\nCrickets clicking in the ferns\\nLike a wheel of fortune\\nI heard my fate turn, turn turn\\nAnd I went running down a white sand

ball\\nOr a forest or a highway\\nOr me here least of all\\nYou couldn't see these cold water restrooms\\nOr this baggage overload\\nWestbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads Turning and turning\\nWithin the widening gyre\\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer\\nThings fall apart\\nThe center cannot hold\\nAnd a blood dimmed tide\\nIs loosed upon the world Nothing is sacred\\nThe

poor drunk bastard falls\\nIn the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years\\nYou think we're sleeping--but\\nQuietly like rattlesnakes and stars\\nWe have seen the trampled rainbows\\nIn the smoke of cars [Chorus]\\nI am Lakota\\nBrave\\nSun pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nBroken\\nMoon pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nGrave\\nShadows stretching\\nLakota\\nOh pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nWeak\\nGrass pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nFaithful\\nRocks pity me\\nI am Lakota\\nMeek\\nStanding water\\nLakota\\nOh pity me I am Lakota!\\nLakota!\\nStanding on sacred land\\nWe never sold these Black Hills\\nTo the missile-heads,\\nTo the power plants\\nWe want the land!\\nThe bullet and the fence, broke Lakota\\nThe black coats and the booze, broke Lakota\\nCourts that circumvent, choke Lakota\\nNothing left to lose\\nTell me grandfather\\nYou spoke the fur and feather tongues,\\nDo you hear the whimpering waters\\nWhen the tractors come? [Chorus] Sun pity me\\nMother earth\\nMother\\nMoon pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nShadows\\nStretching on the forest floor\\nMother earth\\nOh pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nGrass pity me\\nMother earth\\nMother\\nRocks pity me\\nFather sky\\nFather\\nWater\\nStanding in a waken manner\\nMother earth\\nOh pity me I heard it in the wind last night\\nIt sounded like applause\\nDid you get a round resounding for you\\nWay up here\\nSeems like many dim years ago\\nSince I heard that face to face\\nSo seen you face to face\\nThough tonight I can feel you here\\nI get these notes\\nOn butterflies and lilac sprays\\nFrom girls who just have to tell me\\nThey saw you somewhere In some office sits a poet\\nAnd he trembles as he sings\\nAnd he asks some guy\\nTo circulate his soul around\\nOn your mark red ribbon runner\\nThe caressing rev of motors\\nFinely tuned like fancy women\\nIn Thirties evening gowns\\nUp the charts\\nOff to the airport\\nYour name's in the news\\nEverything's first class\\nThe lights go down\\nAnd it's just you up there\\nGetting them to feel like that Remember the days when you used to sit\\nAnd make up your tunes for love\\nAnd pour your simple sorrow\\nTo the sound hole and your knee\\nAnd now you're seen\\nOn giant screens\\nAnd at parties for the press\\nAnd for people who have slices of you\\nFrom the company\\nThey toss around your latest golden egg\\nSpeculation-well, who's to know\\nIf the next one in the nest\\nWill glitter for them so I guess I seem ungrateful\\nWith my teeth sunk in the hand\\nThat brings me things\\nI really can't give up just yet\\nNow I sit up here\\nThe critic!\\nAnd they introduce some band\\nBut they seem so much confetti\\nLooking at them on my TV set\\nOh the power and the glory\\nJust when you're getting a taste for worship\\nThey start bringing out the hammers\\nAnd the boards\\nAnd the nails I heard it in the wind last night\\nIt sounded like applause\\nChilly now\\nEnd of summer\\nNo more shiny hot nights\\nIt was just the arbutus rustling\\nAnd the bumping of the logs\\nAnd the moon swept down black water\\nLike an empty spotlight Once in a while\\nIn a big blue moon\\nThere comes a night like this\\nLike some surrealist\\nInvented this fourth of July\\nNight ride home Hula girls\\nAnd caterpillar tractors in the sand\\nThe ukulele man\\nThe fireworks\\nThis 4th of July\\nNight ride home I love the man beside me\\nWe love the open road\\nNo phones till Friday\\nFar from the overkill\\nFar from the overload Back at the bar\\nThe band tears down\\nBut out here in the headlight beams\\nThe silver power lines\\nGleam\\nOn this fourth of July\\nNight ride home Round the curve\\nAnd a big dark horse\\nRed taillights on his hide\\nIs keeping right alongside\\nRev for stride\\nFourth of July\\nNight ride home I love the man beside me\\nWe love the open road\\nNo phones till Friday\\nFar from the undertow\\nFar from the overload Once in awhile\\nIn a big blue moon\\nThere comes a night like this\\nLike some surrealist\\nInvented this fourth of July\\nNight ride home\\nNight ride home\\nNight ride home\\nOn a night ride home\\nOn a night ride home\\nNight ride home Although I speak in tongues\\nOf men and angels\\nI'm just sounding brass\\nAnd tinkling cymbals without love- Love suffers long-\\nLove is kind!-\\nEnduring all things-\\nLove has no evil in mind If I had the gift of prophecy-\\nAnd all the knowledge-\\nAnd the faith to move the mountains\\nEven if I understood all of the mysteries-\\nIf I didn't have love\\nI'd be nothing Love-never looks for love-\\nLove's not puffed up-\\nOr envious-\\nOr touchy-\\nBecause it rejoices in the truth\\nNot in iniquity\\nLove sees like a child sees As a child I spoke as a child-\\nI thought and I understood as a child-\\nBut when I became a woman-\\nI put away childish things\\nAnd began to see through a glass darkly Where, as a child, I saw it face to face\\nNow, I only know it in part\\nFractions in me\\nOf faith and hope and love\\nAnd of these great three\\nLove's the greatest beauty\\nLove\\nLove\\nLove I was in an all night movie\\nWhen I heard the usher say\\nHere comes the midnight cowboy\\nGot his gun hired out for pay;\\nYou were walking kind of faded\\nFrom the netherlands hotel\\nWith your hat tipped off to ladies\\nReally looking well. Aw joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you falling down\\nGet out of town. Well you came to new york city with a calendar full of gold\\nNow they locked it up in the bedroom\\nAnd they kicked you out in the cold;\\nNow you can't afford a little blanket\\nYou can get one from a friend\\nYou can trick one off the corner\\nYou can even keep the change - to spend. Hey joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you come falling down\\nGet out of town. There's a soldier in the depot\\nHe's a fighting nightingale\\nWearing western boots and buckskin on\\nReading fortunes from the penny scale;\\nNow today he's got a a quarter\\nFor the photograph machine\\nBut tomorrow he'll be lonely lonely\\nThat's the way it's always been. Poor joe, why don't you go back home?\\nReally hate to see you falling down\\nGet out of town. I was in an all night movie\\nWhen I heard the usher say\\nHere comes the midnight cowboy again\\nGot his gun hired out for pay;\\nYou were walking kind of faded\\nFrom the netherlands hotel\\nHat tipped off to ladies\\nTipped off to gentlemen as well. Well joe, why don't you go back home?\\nFind yourself a girl and settle down\\nGet out of town\\nGet out of town\\nFind yourself a girl, go and settle down\\nHey joe, looking more lost than found\\nGet out of town. I was an unmarried girl\\nI'd just turned twenty-seven\\nWhen they sent me to the sisters\\nFor the way men looked at me\\nBranded as a Jezebel\\nI knew I was not bound for Heaven\\nI'd be cast in shame\\nInto the Magdalene laundries Most girls come here pregnant\\nSome by their own fathers\\nBridget got that belly by her parish priest\\nWe're trying to get things white as snow\\nAll of us woe-begotten-daughters\\nIn the streaming stains\\nOf the Magdalene laundries Prostitutes and destitutes\\nAnd temptresses like me\\nFallen women\\nSentenced into dreamless drudgery\\nWhy do they call this heartless place\\nOur Lady of Charity?\\nOh charity! These bloodless brides of Jesus\\nIf they had just once glimpsed their groom\\nThen they'd know, and they'd drop the stones\\nConcealed behind their rosaries\\nThey wilt the grass they walk upon\\nThey leech the light out of a room\\nThey'd like to drive us down the drain\\nAt the Magdalene laundries Peg O'Connell died today\\nShe was a cheeky girl\\nA flirt\\nThey just stuffed her in a hole!\\nSurely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!\\nOne day I'm going to die here too\\nAnd they'll plant me in the dirt\\nLike some lame bulb\\nThat never blooms, come any spring\\nNot any spring Up in a sterilized room\\nWhere they let you be lazy\\nKnowing your attitude's all wrong\\nAnd you got to change\\nAnd that's not easy\\nDragon shining with all values known\\nDazzling you, keeping you from your own\\nWhere is the lion in you to defy him\\nWhen you're this weak\\nAnd this spacey So what are you going to do about it\\nYou can't live life and you can't leave it\\nAdvice and religion, you can't take it\\nYou can't seem to believe it\\nThe peacock is afraid to parade\\nYou're under the thumb of the maid\\nYou really can't give love in this condition\\nStill you know how you need it They open and close you\\nThen they talk like they know you\\nThey don't know you\\nThey're friends and they're foes, too\\nTrouble child\\nBreaking like the waves at Malibu So why does it come as such a shock?\\nTo know you really have no one\\nOnly a river of changing faces\\nLooking for an ocean\\nThey trickle through your leaky plans\\nAnother dream over the dam\\nAnd you're lying in some room\\nFeeling like your right to be human\\nIs going over too\\nWell, some are going to knock you\\nAnd some'll try to clock you\\nYou know it's really hard\\nTo talk sense to you\\nTrouble child\\nBreaking like the waves at Malibu Play, little david\\nPlay little david, play David he would sit in some dark corner\\nSeemed to melt the shadows with his eyes\\nAnd the song that he was playing\\nWas nothing less than prayin'\\nAnd nothing more than sayin' \\\"i'm alive.\\\"\\nWon't you play, little david\\nPlay little david, play David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I don't need no sunday sermon\\nNeed no sunday shoes\\nWhen I hear little david playing\\nI got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I don't need no sunday sermon\\nNeed no sunday shoes\\nWhen I hear little david playing\\nI got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin'\\nSome that laughed and some that felt like tears\\nHe would play them fast or slowly\\nPlay them high or lowly\\nBut they always come out holy to my ear Won't you play, little david, play little david, play\\nWon't you play, little david, play little david, play I had a king in a tenement castle\\nLately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown\\nHe's taken the curtains down\\nHe's swept with the broom of contempt\\nAnd the rooms have an empty ring\\nHe's cleaned with the tears\\nOf an actor who fears for the laughter's sting- [Chorus]\\nI can't go back there anymore\\nYou know my keys won't fit the door\\nYou know my thoughts don't fit the man\\nThey never can they never can I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley\\nLately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind\\nHe lives in another time\\nLadies in gingham still blush\\nWhile he sings them of wars and wine\\nBut I in my leather and lace\\nI can never become that kind [Chorus] I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage\\nWho carried me off to his country for marriage too soon\\nBeware of the power of moons\\nThere's no one to blame\\nNo there's no one to name as a traitor here\\nThe king's on the road\\nAnd the queen's in the grove till the end of the year- [Chorus] Who has seen the wind\\nScalloping the sea\\nOr gliding like a swallow\\nOver villages and trees? \\\"I have\\\", said the willow\\nAnd I begged him please to stay\\nBut he went away\\nHe went on his own one day And I sing, \\\"One love have I\\\"\\nAnd he sings \\\"Now it's goodbye\\\"\\nAnd I sing, \\\"Part of me dies\\nUntil I see you again\\\" Who has seen the sun\\nThrough a parasol of leaves\\nThrough scattered ruby cloud fires\\nThrough the silver wings of bees \\\"I have\\\", said the waters\\nAnd I held his face to mine\\nBut he left in time\\nHe went in his own good time Who has seen the stranger\\nIn a coat of simple brown\\nWith his face of many faces\\nWith his eyes turned out of town I have, and I kissed him\\nAnd I begged him please to stay\\nBut he went away\\nWith the sun and the wind away Where to begin to end uncertainty\\nDo I leave silently or boldly say farewell\\nHow can I think of times that used to be\\nAnd find the smile I need to wish you well But I won't cry for dusty memories\\nNo I won't cry for dreams that couldn't be\\nNo I won't cry The daffodils, the sorry candlelight\\nTo buy my heart when loveless words were spoken\\nToo many tears to welcome in the night\\nToo many promises the days have broken So I won't cry for kisses out of reach\\nNo I won't cry Ill practice what I preach\\nAnd I won't cry No flowers now, no silly candle games\\nSomehow my feet won't lead me to the doorway\\nAnd so I stand and wonder who's to blame\\nWaiting for one last word that calls to beg me stay But I won't cry if that world never comes\\nNo I won't cry for now the story's done\\nAnd I won't cry, goodbye Cold blue steel out of money\\nOne eye for the beat police\\nSweet fire calling\\n\\\"You can't deny me\\nNow you know what you need\\\"\\nUnderneath the jungle gym\\nHollow-grey-fire-escape-thief\\nLooking for sweet fire\\nShadow of Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me\\nI know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you want to contact somebody first\\nLeave someone a letter\\nYou can come now\\nOr you can come later\\\" A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer\\nEdgy-black cracks of the sky\\n\\\"Pin-cushion-prick-\\nFix this poor bad dreamer!\\\"\\n\\\"Money\\\" cold shadows reply\\nPawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked\\nCorridors spit on prayers and pleas\\nSparks fly up from sweet fire\\nBlack soot of Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me\\nI know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you wanna contact somebody first\\nDoes it really matter\\nIf you come now\\nOr if you come on later?\\\" Red water in the bathroom sink\\nFever and the scum brown bowl\\nBlue Steel still begging\\nBut it's indistinct\\nSomeone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll\\nConcrete concentration camp\\nBashing in veins for peace\\nCold blue steel and sweet fire\\nFall into Lady Release\\n\\\"Come with me I know the way\\\" she says\\n\\\"It's down, down, down the dark ladder\\nDo you wanna contact somebody first\\nI mean what does it really matter\\nYou're gonna come now\\nOr you're gonna come later\\\" Downtown\\nMy darling dime store thief\\nIn the War of Independence\\nRock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory\\nUnder neon signs\\nA girl was in bloom\\nAnd a woman was fading\\nIn a suburban room\\nI said, \\\"Take me to the dance\\\"\\n\\\"Do you want to dance?\\\"\\n\\\"I love to dance\\\"\\nAnd I told him, \\\"They don't take chances\\nThey seem so removed from romance\\\"\\n\\\"They've been broken in churches and schools\\nAnd molded to middle class circumstance\\\"\\nAnd we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling Downtown\\nThe dance halls and cafes\\nFeel so wild you could break somebody's heart\\nJust doing the latest dance craze\\nGail and Louise\\nIn those push-up brassieres\\nTight dresses and rhinestone rings\\nDrinking up the band's beers\\nYoung love was kissing under bridges\\nKissing in cars, kissing in cafes\\nAnd we were walking down Main Street\\nKisses like bright flags hung on holidays\\n\\\"In France they kiss on Main Street\\\"\\n\\\"Amour, mama, not cheap display\\\"\\nAnd we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling Downtown\\nIn the pinball arcade\\nWith his head full of pool hall pitches\\nAnd songs from the hit parade\\nHe'd be singing \\\"Bye, Bye, Love\\\"\\nWhile he's racking up his free play\\nLet those rock 'n roll choir boys\\nCome and carry us away\\nSometimes Chickie had the car\\nOr Ron had a car\\nOr Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head\\nWe'd all go looking for a party\\nLooking to raise Jesus up from the dead\\nAnd I'd be kissing in the back seat\\nThrilling to the Brando-like things that he said\\nAnd we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling He bought her a diamond for her throat\\nHe put her in a ranch house on a hill\\nShe could see the valley barbecues\\nFrom her window sill\\nSee the blue pools in the squinting sun\\nHear the hissing of summer lawns He put up a barbed wire fence\\nTo keep out the unknown\\nAnd on every metal thorn\\nJust a little blood of his own\\nShe patrols that fence of his\\nTo a Latin drum\\nAnd the hissing of summer lawns\\nDarkness\\nWonder makes it easy\\nDarkness\\nWith a joyful mask\\nDarkness\\nTube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness\\nNo color no contrast A diamond dog\\nCarrying a cup and a cane\\nLooking through a double glass\\nLooking at too much pride and too much shame\\nThere's a black fly buzzing\\nThere's a heat wave burning in her master's voice\\nHissing summer lawns He gave her his darkness to regret\\nAnd good reason to quit him\\nHe gave her a roomful of Chippendale\\nThat nobody sits in\\nStill she stays with a love of some kind\\nIt's the lady's choice\\nThe hissing of summer lawns There's a crow flying\\nBlack and ragged\\nTree to tree\\nHe's black as the highway that's leading me\\nNow he's diving down\\nTo pick up on something shiny\\nI feel like that black crow\\nFlying\\nIn a blue sky I took a ferry to the highway\\nThen I drove to a pontoon plane\\nI took a plane to a taxi\\nAnd a taxi to a train\\nI've been traveling so long\\nHow's I ever going to know my home\\nWhen I see it again\\nI'm like a black crow flying\\nIn a blue, blue sky In search of love and music\\nMy whole life has been\\nIllumination\\nCorruption\\nAnd diving, diving, diving, diving.\\nDiving down to pick up on every shiny thing\\nJust like that black crow flying\\nIn a blue sky I looked at the morning\\nAfter being up all night\\nI looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light\\nI looked out the window\\nAnd I saw that ragged soul take flight\\nI saw a back crow flying\\nIn a blue sky\\nOh I'm like a black crow flying\\nIn a blue sky I'm always running behind the time\\nJust like this train\\nShaking into town\\nWith the brakes complaining I used to count lovers like railroad cars\\nI counted them on my side\\nLately I don't count on nothing\\nI just let things slide The station master's shuffling cards\\nBoxcars are banging in the yards\\nJealous lovin'll make you crazy\\nIf you can't find your goodness\\n'Cause you lost your heart I went looking for a cause\\nOr a strong cat without claws\\nOr any reason to resume\\nAnd I found this empty seat\\nIn this crowded waiting room (Everybody waiting)\\nOld man sleeping on his bags\\nWomen with that teased up kind of hair\\nKids with the jitters in their legs\\nAnd those wide, wide open stares\\nAnd the kids got cokes and chocolate bars\\nThere's a thin man smoking a fat cigar\\nJealous lovin'll make you crazy\\nIf you can't find your goodness\\n'Cause you've lost your heart What are you going to do now\\nYou've got no one\\nTo give your love too Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind\\nI've got this fold up sink\\nAnd these rocks and these cactus going by\\nAnd a bottle of German wine to drink\\nSettle down into the clickety-clack\\nWith the clouds and the stars to read\\nDreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have\\nWatching your hairline recede, my vain darling\\nWatching your hair and clouds and stars\\nI'm rocking away in a sleeping car\\nThis jealous lovin's bound to make me\\nCrazy\\nI can't find my goodness\\nI lost my heart\\nOh, sour grapes\\nBecause I lost my heart Down in the cellar in the Boho zone\\nI went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well\\nJust another hard-time band\\nWith Negro affectations\\nI was a hopeful in rooms like this\\nWhen I was working cheap\\nIt's an old romance-the Boho dance\\nIt hasn't gone to sleep But even on the scuffle\\nThe cleaner's press was in my jeans\\nAnd any eye for detail\\nCaught a little lace along the seams And you were in the parking lot\\nSubterranean by your own design\\nThe virtue of your style inscribed\\nOn your contempt for mine\\nJesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace\\nAnd Solomon kept his head in all his glory\\nIt's just that some steps outside the Boho dance\\nHave a fascination for me A camera pans the cocktail hour\\nBehind a blind of potted palms\\nAnd finds a lady in a Paris dress\\nWith runs in her nylons You read those books where luxury\\nComes as a guest to take a slave\\nBooks where artists in noble poverty\\nGo like virgins to the grave\\nDon't you get sensitive on me\\n'Cause I know you're just too proud\\nYou couldn't step outside the Boho dance now\\nEven if good fortune allowed Like a priest with a pornographic watch\\nLooking and longing on the sly\\nSure it's stricken from your uniform\\nBut you can't get it out of your eyes Nothing is capsulized in me\\nOn either side of town\\nThe streets were never really mine\\nNot mine these glamour gowns I stepped outside to breathe the air\\nAnd stare up at the stars\\nBig dipper hanging there\\nOver the rented car\\nOver the rented car\\nI'm a runaway from the record biz\\nFrom the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\nTiger, tiger burning bright Sophia says \\\"It's hard to catch\\nAnd harder still to ride\\nThe time to watch the beast the best\\nIs when it's purring at your side\\\"\\nPurring at your side\\nAccolades and honors\\nOne false move and you're a goner\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nIn the forest of the night The moon shed light\\nOn my hopeless plight\\nAs the radio blared so bland\\nEvery disc, a poker chip\\nEvery song just a one night stand\\nFormula music, girly guile\\nGenuine junk food for juveniles\\nUp and down the dial\\nMercenary style I watched the stars chuck down their spears\\nAnd a plane went blinking by\\nAnd I thought of Anna\\nWild and dear\\nLike fireworks in the sky\\nFireworks in the sky\\nI'm so sick of this game\\nIt's hip, it's hot\\nLife's too short, the whole thing's gotten\\nBoring!\\nThe old man is snoring\\nAnd I'm taming the tiger\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\n(You can't tame the tiger)\\nOh, be nice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\nNice, kitty kitty\\n(Boring, boring!)\\nTiger, tiger burning bright\\n(Fight to the light, fight to the light)\\nIn the forest of the night I've got a blue motel room\\nWith a blue bedspread\\nI've got the blues inside and outside my head\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I call you up when I'm down\\nHere in Savannah it's pouring rain\\nPalm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I call you up when I get back to town\\nI know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on\\nHanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm\\nWill you tell those girls that you've got German Measles\\nHoney, tell them you've got germs\\nI hope you'll be thinking of me\\nBecause I'll be thinking of you\\nWhile I'm traveling home alone\\nTell those girls that you've got Joni\\nShe's coming back home I've got road maps\\nFrom two dozen states\\nI've got coast to coast just to contemplate\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to town\\nIt's funny how these old feelings hang around\\nYou think they're gone\\nNo, no\\nThey just go underground\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to L.A. town\\nYou and me, we're like America and Russia\\nWe're always keeping score\\nWe're always balancing the power\\nAnd that can get to be a cold cold war\\nWe're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk\\nIn some neutral cafe\\nYou lay down your sneaking round the town, honey\\nAnd I'll lay down the highway I've got a blue motel room\\nWith a blue bedspread\\nI've got the blues inside and outside my head\\nWill you still love me\\nWhen I get back to town Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions\\nGilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor\\nTreasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where\\nNever mind their questions there's no answer for\\nThe roll of the harbor wake\\nThe songs that the rigging makes\\nThe taste of the spray he takes\\nAnd he learns to give\\nHe aches and he learns to live\\nHe stakes all his silver\\nOn a promise to be free\\nMermaids live in colonies\\nAll his sea dreams come to me City satins left at home I will not need them\\nI believe him when he tells of loving me\\nSomething truthful in the sea your lies will find you\\nLeave behind your streets he said and come to me\\nCome down from the neon nights\\nCome down from the tourist sights\\nRun down till the rain delights you\\nYou do not hide\\nSunlight will renew your pride\\nSkin white by skin golden\\nLike a promise to be free\\nDolphins playing in the sea\\nAll his sea dreams come to me Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings\\nI am smiling at your circles in the air\\nI will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping\\nFold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share\\nA dream that you love someone\\nA dream that the wars are done\\nA dream that you tell no one but the gray sea\\nThey'll say that you're crazy\\nAnd a dream of a baby\\nLike a promise to be free\\nChildren laughing out to sea\\nAll his sea dreams come to me Through the windless wells of wonder\\nBy the throbbing light machine\\nIn a tea leaf trance or under\\nOrders from the king and queen Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one People hurry by so quickly\\nDon't they hear the melodies\\nIn the chiming and the clicking\\nAnd the laughing harmonies Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one Some come dark and strange like dying\\nCrows and ravens whistling\\nLines of weeping, strings of crying\\nSo much said in listening Songs to aging children come\\nAging children, I am one Does the moon play only silver\\nWhen it strums the galaxy\\nDying roses will they will their\\nPerfumed rhapsodies to me Songs to aging children come\\nThis is one She pulls the shade, it's just another\\nSunny Sunday\\nShe dodges the light like Blanche DuBois\\nBright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday\\nShe waits for the night to fall\\nThen she points a pistol through the door\\nAnd she aims at the streetlight\\nWhile the freeway hisses\\nDogs bark as the gun falls to the floor\\nThe streetlight's still burning\\nShe always misses\\nBut the day she hits\\nThat's the day she'll leave\\nThat one little victory, that's all she needs\\nShe pulls the shade it's just another\\nSunny Monday\\nShe waits for the night to fall Out on some borderline\\nSome mark of in between\\nI lay down golden-in time\\nAnd woke up vanishing Sweet bird you are\\nBriefer than a falling star\\nAll these vain promises on beauty jars\\nSomewhere with your wings on time\\nYou must be laughing\\nBehind our eyes\\nCalendars of our lives\\nCircled with compromise\\nSweet bird of time and change\\nYou must be laughing\\nUp on your feathers laughing Golden in time\\nCities under the sand\\nPower, ideals and beauty\\nFading in everyone's hand Give me some time\\nI feel like I'm losing mine\\nOut here on this horizon line\\nWith the earth spinning\\nAnd the sky forever rushing\\nNo one knows\\nThey can never get that close\\nGuesses at most\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching\\nGuesses based on what each set of time and change is touching Fly silly seabird\\nNo dreams can possess you\\nNo voices can blame you\\nFor sun on your wings\\nMy gentle relations\\nHave names they must call me\\nFor loving the freedom\\nOf all flying things\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry I came to the city\\nAnd lived like old Crusoe\\nOn an island of noise\\nIn a cobblestone sea\\nAnd the beaches were concrete\\nAnd the stars paid a light bill\\nAnd the blossoms hung false\\nOn their store window trees\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry Out of the city\\nAnd down to the seaside\\nTo sun on my shoulders\\nAnd wind in my hair\\nBut sandcastles crumble\\nAnd hunger is human\\nAnd humans are hungry\\nFor worlds they can't share\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach out of cry I call to a seagull\\nWho dives to the waters\\nAnd catches his silver-fine\\nDinner alone\\nCrying where are the footprints\\nThat danced on these beaches\\nAnd the hands that cast wishes\\nThat sunk like a stone\\nMy dreams with the seagulls fly\\nOut of reach Out of cry Every picture has its shadows\\nAnd it has some source of light\\nBlindness, blindness and sight\\nThe perils of benefactors\\nThe blessings of parasites\\nBlindness, blindness and sight\\nThreatened by all things\\nDevil of cruelty\\nDrawn to all things\\nDevil of delight\\nMythical devil of the ever-present laws\\nGoverning blindness, blindness and sight Suntans in reservation dining rooms\\nPale miners in their lantern rays\\nNight, night and day\\nHostage smile on presidents\\nFreedom scribbled in the subway\\nIt's like night, night and day\\nThreatened by all things\\nGod of cruelty\\nDrawn to all things\\nGod of delight\\nMythical god of the everlasting laws\\nGoverning day, day and night Critics of all expression\\nJudges in black and white\\nSaying it's wrong, saying it's right\\nCompelled by prescribed standards\\nOr some ideals we fight\\nFor wrong, wrong and right\\nThreatened by all things\\nMan of cruelty-mark of Cain\\nDrawn to all things\\nMan of delight-born again, born again\\nMan of the laws, the ever-broken laws\\nGoverning wrong, wrong and right\\nGoverning wrong, wrong and right\\nWrong and right Twinkle, twinkle what a pity\\nAll alone on such a pretty night\\nWith enchantment on your side Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy\\nSoft voice whispers, \\\"This can all be right\\nIf you'll come and share a ride\\\" Carnival in Kenora\\nI let him take me for a ride\\nOn a giant ferris wheel Up in the neon sky\\nOr far from the barker's cry\\nOne kiss can sometimes\\nMake you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel All the tents are taken down now\\nAll that's left is scuffled ground now\\nStill the magic echoes in the sand Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy\\nNow a stranger takes my hand\\nWe smile and the magic understands Carnival in Kenora\\nI let him take me for a ride\\nOn a giant Ferris wheel Up in the neon sky\\nOr far from the barker's cry\\nOne kiss can sometimes\\nMake you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel Out of the fire like Catholic saints\\nComes Scarlett and her deep complaint\\nMimicking tenderness she sees\\nIn sentimental movies\\nA celluloid rider comes to town\\nCinematic lovers sway\\nPlantations and sweeping ballroom gowns\\nTake her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines\\nChasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn\\nThrough stand-in boys and extra players\\nMagnolias hopeful in her auburn hair\\nShe comes from a school of southern charm\\nShe likes to have things her way\\nAny man in the world holding out his arm\\nWould soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud\\nNeighbors trying to sleep and yelling \\\"Not so loud!\\\"\\nLovers in anger Block of Ice\\nHarder and harder just to be nice\\nGiven in the night to dark dreams\\nFrom the dark things she feels\\nShe covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes\\nRunning from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised\\nCause it is not easy to be brave\\nTo walk around in so much need\\nTo carry the weight of all that greed\\nDressed in stolen clothes she stands\\nCast iron and frail\\nWith her impossibly gentle hands\\nAnd her blood-red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering\\nShe says \\\"A woman must have everything\\\"\\nShades of Scarlett Conquering\\nShe says \\\"A woman must have everything\\\" Tomorrow is Sunday\\nNow there's only one day left to go\\nTill you walk by\\nBelow my window\\nThe weekends drive me mad\\nHolidays are oh too sad\\n'Cause you don't go\\nBelow my window No one knows I'm here\\nOne day I just disappeared\\nAnd I took these two grey rooms up here\\nWith a view\\nWhen you walk by\\nBelow my window You look so youthful\\nTime has been untruthful\\nHeaven knows I loved you\\n30 years ago\\nHot days your shirt's undone\\nRainy days you run\\nOh and then you fade so fast\\nBelow my window No one knows I'm here\\nOne day I just disappeared\\nAnd I took these two grey rooms up here\\nWith a view\\nOnly when you walk by\\nBelow my window\\nWhen you walk by Below my window\\nBelow my window\\nHey hey\\nBelow my window\\nBelow my window\\nBelow my window Three waitresses all wearing\\nBlack diamond earrings\\nTalking about zombies\\nAnd Singapore slings\\nNo trouble in their faces\\nNot one anxious voice\\nNone of the crazy you get\\nFrom too much choice\\nThe thumb and the satchel\\nOr the rented Rolls-Royce\\nAnd you think she knows something\\nBy the second refill\\nYou think she's enlightened\\nAnd she totals your bill\\nYou say \\\"Show me the way\\nTo Barangrill\\\" Well some say it's in service\\nThey say \\\"Humble Makes Pure\\\"\\nYou're hoping it's near Folly\\n'Cause you're headed that way for sure\\nAnd you just have to laugh\\n'Cause it's all so crazy\\nAh, her mind's on her boyfriend\\nAnd eggs over easy\\nIt's just a trick on you\\nHer mirrors and your will\\nSo you ask the truck driver\\nOn the way to the till\\nBut he's just a slave\\nTo Barangrill The guy at the gas pumps\\nHe's got a lot of soul\\nHe sings Merry Christmas for you\\nJust like Nat King Cole\\nAnd he makes up his own tune\\nRight on the spot\\nAbout whitewalls and windshields\\nAnd this job he's got\\nAnd you want to get moving\\nAnd you want to stay still\\nBut lost in the moment\\nSome longing gets filled\\nAnd you even forget to ask\\n\\\"Hey, where's Barangrill?\\\" Rousseau walks on trumpet paths\\nSafaris to the heart of all that jazz\\nThrough I bars and girders-through wires and pipes\\nThe mathematic circuits of the modern nights\\nThrough huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews\\nThrough the class on Park and the trash on Vine\\nThrough Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue\\nThrough savage progress cuts the jungle line In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer\\nRousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear\\nThose cannibals-of shuck and jive\\nThey'll eat a working girl like her alive\\nWith his hard-edged eye and his steady hand\\nHe paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines\\nAnd he hangs a moon above a five-piece band\\nHe hangs it up above the jungle line The jungle line, the jungle line\\nScreaming in a ritual of sound and time\\nFloating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind\\nAnd drooling for a taste of something smuggled in\\nPretty women funneled through valves and smoke\\nCoy and bitchy, wild and fine\\nAnd charging elephants and chanting slaving boats\\nCharging, chanting down the jungle line There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb\\nThere's a poppy snake in a dressing room\\nPoppy poison-poppy tourniquet\\nIt slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit\\nAnd metal skin and ivory birds\\nGo steaming up to Rousseau's vines\\nThey go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge\\nSteaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line It was a rainy night\\nWe took a taxi to your mother's home\\nShe went to Florida and left you\\nWith your father's gun, alone\\nUpon her small white bed\\nI fell into a dream\\nYou sat up all the night and watched me\\nTo see, who in the world I might be I am from the Sunday school\\nI sing soprano in the upstairs choir\\nYou are a holy man\\nOn the F.M. radio\\nI sat up all the night and watched thee\\nTo see, who in the world you might be You called me beautiful\\nYou called your mother-she was very tanned\\nSo you packed your tent and you went\\nTo live out in the Arizona sand\\nYou are a refugee\\nFrom a wealthy family\\nYou gave up all the golden factories\\nTo see, who in the world you might be \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
